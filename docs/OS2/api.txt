                  An alternate video subsystem must register which video calls it handles. The default OS/2 video subsystem is the Base Video Subsystem.

                  When any of the registered functions are called, control is routed to EntryPoint. When this routine is entered, four additional values (5 words) are pushed onto the stack.

                  The first value is the index number (Word) of the routine being called. The second value is a near pointer (Word). The third value is the caller'sDSregister( Word ) . Thefourthvalueisthereturnaddress( DWord )totheVIOrouter .

                  For example, if VioSetCurPos were a registered function, the stack would appear as if the following instruction sequence were executed if VioSetCurPos were called and control routed to EntryPoint:

                  When a registered function returns to the video router, the return code is interpreted as follows:

                  Return code = 0
                        No error. Do not invoke the corresponding Base Video Subsystem routine. Return to caller with Return code = 0. Return code = -1
                        No error. Invoke the corresponding Base Video Subsystem routine. Return to caller with Return code = return code from Base Video Subsystem. Return code = error (not 0 or -1)
                        Do not invoke the corresponding Base Video Subsystem routine. Return to caller with Return code = error. 

                  When an application registers a replacement for VioPopUp within a session, the registered routine is only invoked when that session is in the foreground. If VioPopUp is issued when that session is in the background, the OS/2 default routine is invoked.

                  An alternate video subsystem should be designed so the routines registered do not cause any hard errors when they are invoked. Otherwise, a system lockout occurs. Code and data segments of registered routines, that might be loaded from diskette, must be preloaded.

                  All VIO functions within a session are serialized on a thread basis. That is, when an alternate video subsystem receives control, it can safely assume that it is not called again from the same session until the current call has completed.

VioGlobalReg allows a subsystem to receive notification at the completion of VIO calls issued by all applications running in full-screen sessions.

                  On entry to the global subsystem, AX contains the return code that is returned to the application that issued the VIO call. The global subsystem must return with all stack parameters and all general purpose registers, including AX, restored to the same values as on entry.

                  All VIO functions within a session are serialized on a thread basis. That is, when a global subsystem receives control, it can safely assume that it is not called again from the same session until the current call has completed. Note, however, that VIO calls across different sessions are not serialized.

                  VioGlobalReg may only be issued during system initialization. After system initialization, VioGlobalReg returns ERROR_VIO_REGISTER. A globally registered subsystem is active for the life of the system.

                  If multiple global subsystems are registered, they are given control in the order that they are registered.

                  A globally registered subsystem receives control on VIO calls issued from all full-screen sessions except the hard error handler and DOS (real mode) sessions.
