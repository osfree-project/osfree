Multiboot OS/2 booter description.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OS/2 booter (bootos2.mdl) is the multiboot kernel which can be used with FreeLdr
as well as GRUB. It is intended for booting OS/2 using these bootloaders. OS/2
booter loads all needed files to memory (they are specified as multiboot modules)
and then installs special micro- and minifsd which read files from memory by requests
of os2ldr and os2krnl. So, you can think of it as an mbi (multiboot info) micro-
and minifsd which boot OS/2 from a special FS-like structure in memory. So, it
is like a yet another memdisk technology for booting OS/2. (Or a technology
similar to a memfiles, preloaded to memory by OS/4 kernel). The difference from
a Veit Kannegieser's memdisk is that OS/2 does not boot from emulated memory drive
but a boot drive letter is assigned to a real boot drive (a CD, a flash disk or alike)
but not a memdrive.

The limitation now is that this is a IFS-only booting solution, so you cannot use it for
booting using in-kernel FAT filesystem. As a workaround, you can use vfat-os2.ifs
filesystem (unfortunately, it is unstable, but currently, it has no stable replacement).

Syntax:

kernel $(DRV)\boot\loader\bootos2.mdl [options]

where options are the following

--debug       switches on commport debug

--port=<...>  specifies a commport base address. For example, '--port=0x3f8'

--speed=<...> specifies a commport speed, for example, '--port=115200'

The standard comport parameters for bootos2 are: 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit. The default
port is 0x3f8. The default port speed is 9600 baud.

--drv=<drive letter|dlat|auto> specifies a drive letter assignment.

a) '--drv=u:'     means to assign an 'u:' drive letter to the boot drive
b) '--drv=auto'   is intended for booting with danidasd.dmd. When using this
                  assignment mode, uFSD scans all available drives for supported
                  partitions and finds the 1st available drive letter. This drive
                  letter is assigned to the boot drive. This mode is mainly intended
                  for booting from flash drive using danidasd.dmd. The flash drive
                  is usually a removable drive. There is a limitation of danidasd
                  that a removable drives are assigned a drive letters immediately
                  after the fixed drives, and no unused drive letters allowed between
                  fixed and removable drives.
c) '--drv=dlat'   is intended for booting when usind os2lvm.dmd. In this mode,
                  a drive letter is taken from the LVM DLAT info and assigned
                  to a boot drive. This is mainly intended for booting from
                  fixed drives.

--fs=<FS name>            specifies a Filesystem name. FS name is a value of a FS_NAME
                          exported symbol of an IFS. A value of FS name of miniFSD must
                          exactly match a value of the same symbol in the IFS.

--module=<module name>    specifies a boot IFS module name. An IFS is a dynamic link
                          library which has predefined entry points. As any DLL, IFS
                          has its module name which length cannot exceed 8 characters.

A table of known FS and module names for different IFS'es:

FS            | module                 | FS name
----------------------------------------------------------
fat32.ifs     | FAT32                  | FAT32
hpfs.ifs      | HPFS                   | HPFS
jfs.ifs       | JFS                    | JFS
ext2-os2.ifs  | EXT2-OS2               | ext2
vfat-os2.ifs  | VFAT-OS2               | vfat
cdfs.ifs      | CDFS (CDFSD for debug) | CDFS
ntfs.ifs      | NTFS                   | NTFS
---------------------------------------------------------
Note: a FS name and module name are case-sensitive!
