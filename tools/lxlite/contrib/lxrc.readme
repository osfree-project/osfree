This directory contains the source code for lxLite resources. Resources
contain all lxLite messages as well as all API names that lxLite knows.
You can add your own sets of API functions to file OS2API.RC then to
recompile resources using OS/2 Resource Compiler (use LXRC.CMD for this).

NOTE: You are not allowed to change program copyright message.
