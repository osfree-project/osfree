                         Regina 3.0
                        25 April 2002

Changes in this release (from 2.2)
----------------------------------

o Fixed a bug with a crash under Win32 when trying to load a function
  with rxfuncadd() and that function does not exist in the external function
  package.
o Added ANSI enhancements to ADDRESS command. Now supports full WITH options.
  This feature implemented by Florian Grosse-Coosmann.
o New port of Regina to EPOC32. Regina now runs on Psion 5mx/Revo/Revo Plus
  and those mobile phones that run EPOC32 operating system. The RexxStart
  package for EPOC32 also comes with an online Regina quick reference guide.
o Added -a switch to specify that separate arguments should be passed to the
  Rexx program. 
  eg without the -a switch (default behaviour of all Rexx interpreters)
     % rexx fred "this has spaces" mary
  /**/
  Parse Source . how .
  Say how     /* -> COMMAND */
  Say Arg(1)  /* -> fred this has spaces mary */
  Say Arg(2)  /* -> */
  Say Arg(3)  /* -> */
  Say Arg()   /* -> 1 */
     % rexx -a fred "this has spaces" mary
  /**/
  Parse Source . how .
  Say how     /* -> SUBROUTINE */
  Say Arg(1)  /* -> fred */
  Say Arg(2)  /* -> this has spaces */
  Say Arg(3)  /* -> mary */
  Say Arg()   /* -> 3 */
  You can determine how the Rexx program was called by checking the
  second word in PARSE SOURCE as the above example shows.
o Add regina-config creation under Un*x platforms. This is to simplify the
  determination of what flags to use to build a program that links with Regina.
o Files are now truncated properly with LINEOUT() on QNX 4.2x
o Added UPPER instruction to ease porting from those platforms that support
  the UPPER instruction.
o TRACE command now supports numeric values when in interactive trace. TRACE with
  a positive whole number will execute the number of clauses using the current TRACE
  setting without any prompting. TRACE with a negative whole number will execute the
  number of clauses without prompting, and with a temporary TRACE O in effect. TRACE 0
  is the same as TRACE O.
o Added 'T' option to TIME and DATE BIFs to return the current Unix time_t value.
  'T' format can also be used in time and date conversions.
o Slight change of behaviour when Regina looks for external functions in
  directories PATH. Regina will no longer look for an external function
  without an extension.  This is to allow Regina to allow operating system
  commands to be called as functions: eg. a = 'ls'() will now work as it did
  before the change to search PATH as well as REGINA_MACROS. If you have an
  external routine called 'ls.rexx' in PATH, it will still find it!
o Added new OPTION: STRICT_ANSI (replaces ANSI OPTION). If you specify STRICT_ANSI
  in an OPTIONS statement, Regina will disallow any Regina functionality that is
  not part of the ANSI standard. (This is an ongoing exercise).
  Restrictions currently implemented:
  - C and T options on DATE BIF
  - J and T options on TIME BIF
  - BIFs not allowed: 
    ALLOCATED,BEEP,BUFTYPE,CD,CHDIR,CLOSE,CRYPT,DESBUF,DIRECTORY,DROPBUF,DUMPFILES,
    DUMPTREE,DUMPVARS,EOF,All VMS F$ functions,FILESPEC,FIND,FINIS,FORK,FREELISTS,
    GETENV,GETPATH,GETPID,GETTID,INDEX,JUSTIFY,LISTLEAKED,MAKEBUF,MEMORYSTATS,OPEN,
    POPEN,SLEEP,STATE,TRACEBACK,UNAME,UNIXERROR,USERID
  - Instructions not allowed:
    UPPER
    ADDRESS (env)
  - Treating operating system commands as functions. eg: a = 'ls'() will
    return an error 43.1.
o Initial native language support added. This release allows for error
  messages to be displayed in a user-selectable native language.
  All native language error messages are contained in binary files (*.mtb) that
  are built with the Regina executables from source files (*.mts).
  The mechanism Regina uses to determine what native language to use to display
  error messages depends on the operating system. 
  On EPOC32, the language is supplied when installing; the selected language
  is contained in default.mtb.
  On all other platforms, Regina uses environment variables if you want to use a
  language other than English. The English messages are built into the interpreter.
  Up to 2 environment variables are used. 
  REGINA_LANG environment variable can be set to an ISO 639, 2 character
  language abbreviation as defined below. 

  Abbrev Language       Translation By             EPOC32?
     de  German         Floran Grosse-Coosmann        Y
     es  Spanish        Pablo Garcia-Abia             Y
     no  Norwegian      Vidar Tysse                   Y
     pt  Portuguese     Susana and Brian Carpenter    Y
  
  If REGINA_LANG is not set, the default is "en".

  REGINA_LANG_DIR is required if Regina does not know where the language files
  will be at runtime.
  Any binary distribution that includes an installation routine; RPM, Windows
  InstallShield or EPOC32, will set the location of the .mtb files automatically. 
  Similarly building and installing Regina on Unix-like platforms using 
  configure;make install combination will also set the location automatically.  
  All other platforms will require this environment variable to bet set manually.
o Continuing addition of more sub-error reporting.
o Added new command to RXQUEUE() BIF; TIMEOUT.  This allows the setting of a timeout
  value on an external queue, so that a subsequent PULL from the queue can be made
  to timeout after a certain period (specified in milliseconds), or wait indefinitely
  (specify a timeout of 0).
o When a Rexx program is run from the Win32 Explorer or from the Start->Run prompt,
  Regina will display a prompt and require the user to press ENTER to close the
  console window. This is to allow the output from the Rexx program to be seen.
o Added binaries to create and execute tokenised code files. 
o Fixed a crash with some combinations of compound variables, and minor bug
  with TRACE. Fixed by Mark Wooding
o Interactive tracing state now correctly remembered across subroutine
  calls. Fixed by Mark Wooding
o Changed error reporting of unmatched comments, as per feature Request:
  #508788. Error message now reflects comment starting line rather than
  end of file line.
o Added '.rx' as a recognised file extension.
o Fixed bug with negative values passed to TIME BIF.
o Added capabilities to run Regina in "safe" mode.  This mode is useful for
  running in an environment where the Rexx program should be
  prevented from changing the environment in which it is running. eg as a
  database procedural language. See README_SAFE for more information.
o Added new builtin environments: REXX and REGINA, to allow Rexx programs
  to be run in another process.
o Fixed bug with rxstack when using timeouts on queues, and with deleting
  lines off the queue when they are pulled off.
o Fixed bug with FORK BIF on unsupported platforms.  It now correctly returns 1
  instead of 0 if FORK unsupported.

Cheers, Mark.
