There's new syntax for attrib command (@todo: change oso*.txt!):
attrib <params1> <files1> [params2] [files2]
where files are files on which we will do attribute change, params1 works for
files1, and params2 works for files2 and so on,
thus /s which in IBM's attrib could be at the end, here can't!

valid params are attrib operations and:
 /s - recurse into subdir
 /d - disables setting attributes for directories (only files will be processed) 

attrib operations:
+ - setting
- - resetting
~ - inverting
= - sets specified attrib resetting the rest

if you specify more then one attrib operation, the higher priority has the last
one eg.: -RH +S =A results in =A (wchich can be read as +A-RHS also)

oh btw :) -- turns parameters scanning, so (unlike in IBM version) you can
change attribs for eg "+s" file

Have a fun :)
