(* This interrupts called by hardware. For now uni not used for such low lovel 

INT 00h-- 	CPU: Executed after an attempt to divide by zero or when the quotient does not fit in the destination
INT 01h 	CPU: Executed after every instruction while the trace flag is set
INT 02h 	CPU: NMI, used e.g. by POST for memory errors
INT 03h 	CPU: The lowest non-reserved interrupt, it is used exclusively for debugging, and the INT 03 handler is always implemented by a debugging program
INT 04h 	CPU: Numeric Overflow. Usually caused by the INTO instruction when the overflow flag is set.
INT 05h 	Executed when Shift-PrintScreen is pressed, as well as when the BOUND instruction detects a bound failure.
INT 06h 	CPU: Called when the Undefined Opcode (invalid instruction) exception occurs. Usually installed by the operating system.
INT 07h 	CPU: Called when an attempt was made to execute a floating-point instruction and no numeric coprocessor was available.
INT 08h 	IRQ0: Implemented by the system timing component; called 18.2 times per second (once every 55 ms) by the PIC
INT 09h 	IRQ1: Called after every key press and release (as well as during the time when a key is being held)
INT 0Bh 	IRQ3: Called by serial ports 2 and 4 (COM2/4) when in need of attention
INT 0Ch 	IRQ4: Called by serial ports 1 and 3 (COM1/3) when in need of attention
INT 0Dh 	IRQ5: Called by hard disk controller (PC/XT) or 2nd parallel port LPT2 (AT) when in need of attention
INT 0Eh 	IRQ6: Called by floppy disk controller when in need of attention
INT 0Fh 	IRQ7: Called by 1st parallel port LPT1 (printer) when in need of attention

procedure BiosVideo(Num: BYTE; arg1: BYTE; arg2: BYTE);

(*
INT 11h 	Installed by the BIOS; returns equipment list
INT 12h 	Installed by the BIOS or operating system; returns Conventional Memory Size
*)

(* Low level Disk Services. This is generic call. For more functions see disk.uni *)
INT 13h 	Low Level Disk Services; installed by the BIOS or operating system; called by software programs
INT 14h 	Routines for communicating via the serial port. Used by software programs.
INT 15h 	Miscellaneous (System services support routines)
INT 16h 	Implemented by the BIOS or operating system. Provides routines to be called by software programs which communicate with the keyboard.
INT 17h 	Print Services - used by software programs to communicate with the printer

(*
INT 18h 	Execute Cassette BASIC: True IBM computers contain BASIC in the ROM to be interpreted and executed by this routine in the event of a boot failure (called by the BIOS)
INT 19h 	After POST this interrupt is used by BIOS to load the operating system.
*)

INT 1Ah 	Real Time Clock Services - called by software programs to communicate with the RTC

(*
INT 1Bh 	Installed by the operating system; automatically called by INT 9 when Ctrl-Break has been pressed
INT 1Ch 	Called automatically by INT 08; available for use by software programs when a routine needs to be executed regularly
INT 1Dh 	Not to be called; simply a pointer to the VPT (Video Parameter Table), which contains data on video modes
INT 1Eh 	Not to be called; simply a pointer to the DPT (Diskette Parameter Table), containing a variety of information concerning the diskette drives
INT 1Fh 	Not to be called; simply a pointer to the VGCT (Video Graphics Character Table), which contains the data for ASCII characters 80h to FFh
INT 41h 	Address pointer: FDPT = Fixed Disk Parameter Table (1st hard drive)
INT 46h 	Address pointer: FDPT = Fixed Disk Parameter Table (2nd hard drive)
INT 4Ah 	Called by RTC for alarm
INT 70h 	IRQ8: Called by RTC
INT 74h 	IRQ12: Called by mouse
INT 75h 	IRQ13: Called by math coprocessor
INT 76h 	IRQ14: Called by primary IDE controller
INT 77h 	IRQ15: Called by secondary IDE controller
