 [;] Comment
 [*] Modified
 [+] Added feature
 [-] Removed feature
 [!] Bug fix

 1.3.9
 ----- 26-Sept-2017
  [+]  Avoid runtime error 2003 for very large debug data by Steven H. Levine
  [+]  Support /X:page by Steven H. Levine
  [*]  Support redirection in unlock by Andreas Buchinger
  [+]  UDF unlock extension by Veit
  [+]  add rpm awareness to lxLite
  [+]  send error messages to stderr

 1.3.8
 ----- 06-Mar-2015
  [+]  Selection of offset types added for /MFA & /MFB, now 8, 16 and 32-bit
       offsets can be applied separately (selectable by bit mask).
       I.e. /mfb:2 - apply only 16-bit offset fixups to all module types.
  [*]  Aurora's DOSCALLS entries added to known API list
  [!]  DosEditName replacement written, at last - so dump options now works
       in Windows build.

 1.3.7
 ----- 13-Dec-2013
  [+]  Forced fixup apply added - /MFB key. Normal apply (/MFA) gets only EXE
       modules, but WLINK can produce basedev drivers with unapplied (and
       void) "16-bit offset" fixups. So /MFB option is the same as /MFA, but
       for all module types.

 1.3.6
 ----- 04-Mar-2013
  [+]  Windows build. Any options with dump writing (debug, stub) will cause
       error (feel free to write DosEditName replacement if you want it back)

 1.3.5
 ----- 02-Feb-2010
  [+]  Minor fixup dump addition

 1.3.4
 ----- 21-Apr-2009
  [+]  OS/4 kernel new compression method pack/unpack (/c:kernel), view, etc.
  [+]  Switches /PW and /PR - export/import raw page data into binary file
       Can be used only one of them at run (/c:noinfo /pw:1-20:dump.bin).
  [+]  Switch /PZ- - for some strange reasons. (/PZ+ by default). It do not
       affect to fixup unpack/apply.

 1.3.3
 ----- 05-Dec-2003
  [*]  Page alignment code cleanup
  [!]  Some "already processed" binaries were rejected to unpack
  [!]  Name tables handling, no junk entries anymore
  [!]  Compression was slightly degraded in 1.3.2
  [*]  Getting rid of assembler routines: this time it's QuickSort
  [;]  Improvements by Veit Kannegieser incorporated (more to come):
  [!]  Exported entries are shown correctly when ordinals have gaps
  [*]  DosReplaceModule is now defined in SysLib; os2lib/ is removed
  [-]  Use32.pas removed, some stuff moved to miscUtil, &Use32+ is in use

 1.3.2
 ----- 01-Apr-2002 still being bugfixed
  [!]  Fixed conversion of NE-modules with IOPL segments (thanks to Veit Kannegieser)
  [!]  lxLite used wrong Page Offset Shift in verbose mode
  [*]  Some changes in the documentation

 1.3.1
 ----- 22-May-2001 yet another bugfix
  [!]  Fixed some bugs caused by change of VP version.
  [!]  Switch /V{...} broke processing of NE-modules
  [+]  New switches /VX and /VD (turned on by default)
  [*]  Cosmetic changes in noEA
  [-]  Obsolete German documentation

 1.3.0
 ----- 1-Jan-2001 lxLite is still alive!
  [;]  Andrew blessed me (Max Alekseyev) to continue support of lxLite.
  [*]  Now lxLite is compiled with Virtual Pascal 2.1
       Rewritten VP 1.x dependent code to be compatible with VP 2.x
  [!]  Serious bug in an auxiliary unit Collect has been found and fixed.
       It causes failure when processing some modules.
  [!]  Now lxLite can process LX-modules with fake offset to an absent
       FixUp Record Table.
  [!]  Now lxLite can process LX-modules with zero Object Iterated Pages
       Offset (in this case it's considered equal to Object Page Table Offset).
  [!]  Bug in error reporting has been fixed.

 1.2.1
 ----- 17-Aug-97 small bugfix
  [!]  Improved handling of filenames with forward slashes instead of
       backslashes
  [!]  (yet again :-() changed the 'already packed' detection algorithm.
       The problem with it is that lxLite does not put any kind of
       'fingerprint' into processed files so I have to decide whenever
       it has been processed or not only by side effects.
  [*]  Made noEA's output a bit quieter. Now without /V option noEA
       shows all file names in one line and with /V option noEA advances
       to next line only for those files that has EAs.
  [!]  chCase is back now! I understood why chCase messed up filenames
       when codepage was 437 :-( Sorry to those who had to reformat
       their HD to get rid of messy filenames ;-( it is mostly IBM's
       fault, not mine. This sometimes breaks HPFS's filename BSP tree
       and makes files totally unreachable, undeletable etc.

 1.2.0
 ----- 10-Jul-97
 [!!!] Mega-bug fix :-) I caught a very serious error in lxLite. However,
       I've encountered it only on GNU C++ compiler executable when I
       tried to pack it using RLE (/c:ver2x) method, so it is not too
       probable that you seen it before :-) The problem was following:
       for some unknown reason the guys at IBM decided that whenever a
       packed page is bigger than 0xFFC bytes, it is an error. To understand
       this, I had to dig through the OS/2 kernel (whew!). So if the
       compression ratio for some page was really worse (this happens much
       seldom on EXEPACK2 (LZ) method since it packs better, and often on
       RLE method since it sucks), the page was simply missing at its
       memory location (!). In such cases a record is added to POPUPLOG.OS2,
       looking very unusual (no registers, no location etc).
  [!]  noEA will not bomb out anymore when it tries to process a completely
       locked file (i.e. ea data. sf).
  [*]  In some situations (very high ordinals in entry table) lxLite began
       to eat lots of memory, and this usually terminated with an
       out-of-swap-space trap :-( Fixed.

 1.1.9
 ----- 10-May-97 Upgrade for version 1.1.8
  [*]  lxLite is distributed now under GNU General Public License (GPL).
  [*]  lxLite's documentation is now in both .HTML and .INF format
       (the .INF book is converted for your convenience with HTML2IPF).
  [!]  Oooooops! I've left a debug sequence in fixup packing section,
       so really fixups were packed ONLY at page N20! :-)
  [*]  Added a little tolerance to minor (and even severe) bugs in fixip
       table which could lead lxLite to display an 'invalid fixup record'
       message.
  [*]  More tolerance to incorrect debug information (exceeds executable,
       encountered on FASTECHO/2 1.46).
  [!]  Yet again improved 'already-packed' modules detection :-)
  [+]  Added the /C{+|-} option for those with a B/W monitors
  [+]  Added the /CS{+|-} option for those who prefer writing to stdout.
       Actually lxLite isn't entirely an stdOut program, it still uses VioXXX
       to do some things, notably get console width and height. You can put
       this option in the [default] section of config file to force lxLite
       always write to stdout.
  [+]  Disabled the progress bar indicator when StdOut is redirected. Now
       you can use lxLite >alternateLogFile without getting much garbage.
       Try lxLite * | more :-)
  [!]  Captain Nemo's INI file (NEMO-OS2.INI) has a perfect NE executable
       structure :-))) so I added NEMO-OS2.INI to the list of excluded files.
  [+]  Added ability to apply (/MFA{+|-}) fixups since some executables
       (observed on FASTECHO2.EXE - written using Borland C++ for OS/2)
       were linked without /BASE: linker flag which leads to slower loading
       times and bigger executables without need since executables are
       always loaded at 0x10000. This option work only for .EXEs.
  [*]  Now the /V flag works *after* lxLite processes module, so you will see
       the *final* result of conversion, not the *original* module information.
       Of course, you can still see the original if you'll disable all lxLite
       processing (the /C:info switch will do it for you).

 1.1.8
 ----- 01-Mar-97; well, its THE time for a new release :-)
  [!]  Fixed a serious bug in run-length packing method: the kernel
       decompressor expects two zeros at the end of packed data and lxLite
       didn't put them there. The bug is since first lxlite release, so if
       you previously encountered problems (especially using /C:Ver2x switch)
       you should try to re-pack damaged modules (lxLite will correctly
       unpack even "incorrect" modules, then will correctly pack them).
       Big thanks to Vallat Christophe for pointing out this bug.
  [+]  Now to reply to any question you can instead of pressing simply
       [L]etter press <Alt>+[L]etter which will set the default reply for
       all following similar questions.
  [+]  Added the /MF3 fixup packing method which will find the best
       alternative for each page between /MF1 and /MF2. However this is
       a bit slow and does not give too much gain, so default is still /MF1.
  [!]  Fixed a serious bug in /MF2 packing method. Lucky for you, previous
       version was not public.
  [*]  Now you cannot proceed module along with displaying module structure
       (i.e. /V option has priority over any other).

 1.1.8g
 ----- 15-Feb-97, a year from first public release :-)
  [+]  Added some extra gain since now all fixed-up locations are filled
       with zeros before packing. For modules with pre-applied fixups this
       operation is not performed.
  [+]  Added fixup packing method for Warp 4.0 (3.0 with fixpack #17) and
       above (/MF2). This option is still at beta-test stage, so use with
       care (by default it is disabled now). Anyway, this method has proven
       to be less effective sometimes than /MF1 with above correction.
       And note that on most executables this method will have absolutely
       no effect: it is primarily intended for DLLs. Also note that when
       fixup packing is enabled, the /U{+|-} option is ignored - module is
       always unpacked first. The /MF2 option is ignored for modules with
       pre-applied fixups (for example DOSCALL1.DLL).

 1.1.8b
 ----- 25-Jan-97, my birthday :-)
  [;]  WARNING: This is a PUBLIC BETA version; it still contains bugs,
       especially in NE->LX conversion routines. USE WITH CARE.
       I tested it for about a month, and found THREE executables on which
       lxLite fails to convert (i.e. didn't convert right from NE format
       into LX): please avoid them:

     - OS2DASD.DMD with beta support for HPFS on removable drives
       (other versions converts OK): halt on reboot with a "Unable to
       operate your hard drive" message.
     - RESOURCE.SYS from Warp 4.0 GA: Trap 0D on first keypress after
       it is loaded.
     - ES1688.SYS driver for ESS-1688 soundcard; trap when loading.

       I do not understand why this is happening; everything seems ok,
       but something is wrong :-( That's why I'm releasing this public
       beta version: PLEASE REPORT ME ANY CASES WHEN LXLITE FAILS.
       Contact information is available at the end of LXLITE.ENG file.

  [*]  Changed configuration file format: now it is Unix-alike, i.e.
       configuration option is defined using square brakets, for
       example [default]; next lines are interpreted as command-line
       options that are loaded when loading specific section.

  [!]  Fixed two bugs in NE fixups conversion routine: this possibly
       caused most of failures when converting NE modules before.

  [+]  Added exclusions and additional-options-based-on-filemasks needed
       to entirely compress Watcom C subdirectory without losing
       functionality of any executable.

  [*]  Added the /NR switch; now lxLite will fail to convert NE files that
       contains resources; use the /NR option with care, especially on DLLs
       since you must know what executables uses that DLL and which
       function (Dos16GetResource or Dos16GetResource2) they're using
       to load resources.

 1.1.7b
 ----- internal release
  [;]  Now lxLite converts NE executables into LX. Uhhh! Lots'o'work done.
       Lots'o'things changed. Lots'o'options added. Some options has been
       renamed, some merged into one, so read at least following info before
       trying new version.

  [*]  IMPORTANT: Now all options that can be followed by a string
       (i.e. file name, configuration ID) must have a semicolon before
       string, i.e. /C:default, /L:mylog etc.

  [*]  IMPORTANT: I changed a lot of options to make them more mnemonic:
       The /D option now is called /E ([E]xclude); /E option has been
       renamed into /R ([R]ecursive); /R option has been added to /A
       option (which still works in old way (say /APS); you also can
       directly specify new page shift count i.e. /A:4; you can use
       them both ways i.e. /APS:4);

  [*]  Changed a lot of internals so it it possible for some bugs to appear.

  [*]  If you choose to load a specific configuration, and configuration
       file contains more than one line that matches that config ID,
       lxLite will load all such lines, not only the first as before, so
       you can split very long configurations into some number of lines.

  [*]  Removed from configuration file options /C:failSafe, /C:fast,
       /C:fast2 because they're useless: experience shows that executables
       packed with /C:default loads and works faster.

  [!]  Increased stack space: small stack space is very like to cause all
       those strange crashes of lxLite on deep directory trees.

  [!]  Some minor memory leaks has been fixed

  [+]  Added functionality to VERBOSE mode: now you can specify what kind
       of information you want to see. lxLite can serve as an replacement
       for EXEMAP and EXEHDR programs :-) More detailed description you can
       find in documentation (English only, the German docs refers to version
       1.1.5). For displaying exported entry points, fixups and forwarders,
       lxLite now knows a lot of API functions by name. Today lxLite knows
       by name all documented API functions in all base OS/2 dynamic-link
       libraries. You can add your own - see the resources in API\
       subdirectory.

  [+]  When displaying long texts (i.e. /V{...} option, help text) lxLite
       will use a kind of 'MORE' prompt.

  [+]  Bundles of entry points now are re-packed although seems that in
       most cases they are packed well.

  [+]  Fixup records now are also re-packed, although in most cases they
       are already compressed. If you run lxLite on a previously packed
       file (with earlier versions) and you get some gain, it means that
       fixup records (or entry points bundles) has not been packed at
       the maximum possible level. If you got BIGGER files, please
       let me know :-)

  [!]  Corrected a bug which leaded to loss of non-resident name table
       (usually it contains executable description) with a message
       'LX file contains extra bytes' when it isn't.

  [+]  Improved a bit 'already-compressed' executables detection.

  [+]  Added the /J option to change executable type: use it for
       converted NE drivers since NE drivers are marked as DLLs; LX
       drivers always must be marked as Device Drivers, otherwise they
       will not load successfully.

  [+]  Added the ability to use some specific configuration options
       for filenames that matches specific filemask. For example,
       if in configuration file you'll specify the entry:
       @a*z.c?$: /B
       this will enable backups for files that matches the "a*z.c?$"
       filemask, i.e. aaaz.cc$, abcdefgz.ca$ but not for the bcde.cc$.
       A side effect of this is that you can encounter a option syntax
       error in the middle of the process, not only at the start.

  [+]  Improved a bit the /L option: now you can choose which types
       of events you want to log; be careful: now the log filename
       MUST BE SEPARATED BY A COLON from /L{...}, i.e. /L:"log file"

  [+]  Improved the /B option: now you can choose to backup only in
       the cases when module contains e[X]tra or [D]ebug data. Also you
       can choose to place backups in a certain directory; for example
       with the /B:bak option lxLite will place all backed up files
       into the \BAK\ directory on the current drive, recreating
       the same directory structure as the original file was placed in.

  [*]  The /G option has been merged with the /O option; the /G option
       now is gone.

  [+]  Modified the /W option: in the /WS+ state lxLite will perform
       just like always, except that it won't write output file (and
       will display compression rate too unlike in the /W- state).

  [*]  lxLite utility pack: version of utilities now will be the same as
       for lxLite. So all enclosed utilities (chCase, noEA etc) now have
       version 1.1.7

  [*]  Options in utilities changed according to changes in lxLite:
       recursive search changed from /E to /R etc.

  [+]  ChCase: The option /C{...} has been extended: now you can define
       separate rules for [F]iles and for [D]irectories: The /CF{...}
       switch will define case conversion rules for [F]iles and /CD{...}
       switch will define them for [D]irectories. If used in old fashion
       (i.e. /C{...}) it will work both for files and directories.

  [!]  Both chCase and lxLite when processing a file with no attributes
       (i.e. attrib -a-h-s-r) will set the Archive flag.

  [-]  Removed ColMng from lxLite utility pack because of its usefulness
       and excessive complexity for most users :-)

  [+]  Added/changed a whole lot of other things I don't remember now.

 1.1.6
 ----- internal release
  [-]  Removed sources from base distribution. The sources are still
       available on request (see docs for "how to contact" information).
       This was done since they grow in size very fast (they use some of
       my external libraries - a function-two from each) and not too much
       people really needs them.
  [!]  Fixed a bug - the /GX{#} option worked only in /OX+ state
  [*]  Improved a bit help on /O{G|D|X} option
  [!]  Fixed a number of minor bugs in error-correction logic
  [*]  Changed default option in unLock from /V+ to /V-
  [*]  Changed default option in chCase from /V+ to /V-
  [*]  Before unlocking file all utilities saves now file date/time;
       after unlocking they're restoring date & time, although this
       is an overkill (?).

 1.1.5
 ----- 19-Jun-96 another bug fix :-)
  [!]  AT LAST! The famous 'cannot open configuration file' bug fixed :-)
       The problem was that CMD.EXE puts in environment the command line
       that you used to start lxLite AS-IS while 4OS2 replaced it by
       fully-qualified lxLite filename followed by its command-line
       parameters. I used it to compute lxLite's source path; however
       program's environment contains ANOTHER fully-qualified filename
       path which I use now :-) and which is ALWAYS fully-qualified.
  [+]  Because nobody understands how the /G switch works (I got a lot of
       e-mail regarding this) I added a new switch: /O{X|D|S}{+|-}. If it
       is disabled (/O-, default state) the /G switch works as before, i.e.
       the data is written only if discarded from source file. If the /O+
       option is used, the data is written always (if filemask is specified
       by /G option).
  [!]  Fixed an non-serious bug in CRT.PAS - now lxLite works as expected
       even if it is redirected into a device other than CON (i.e. /dev/nul),
       not only into files or pipes.
  [+]  After a lot of thoughts I added into lxLite utility pack my first PM
       program for OS/2 - SysIcons. It is an simple program which allow you
       to change system pointers (including but not limiting to mouse pointers,
       as System Setup->Mouse->Pointer does). Also I included three of my best
       sets of pointers - one which I partially designed myself, partially
       acquired from different sources, second is the B&W version of first
       and third (white gloves) which I got from somewhere and converted to
       B&W (because on my Cirrus Logic B&W pointers are supported by hardware
       and does not flicker). Sorry to the author of White Gloves set, but I
       lost original archive and copyright notice; I hope you'll excuse me.
   [!] Improved a bit error checking; previous versions sometimes (seldom)
       failed on almost-good-exe-files (specifically GVPM.EXE which had one
       of non-mandatory internal table beyond the limits of EXE files which
       caused lxLite to fail with an runtime error).

 1.1.4
 ----- 14-Jun-96 minor fixes & additions
  [!]  Fixed displaying the question about extra LX data - I forgot to add
       an carriage return after it. Also I removed the warning about the
       possibility that resulting file will become non-functional.
  [!]  Fixed a stupid bug (sizeOf(F) instead of fileSize(F)) which sometimes
       forced lxLite to discard debug info even if you specify to leave
       it in resulting file. In such cases lxLite displayed that file
       has X bytes of extra data and the same amount of debug info.
  [+]  Added an sub-option for /G[X|D|S]{#} - the /GX option now specifies
       the filemask for files where to store stubs (even if lxlite won't
       remove them).
  [!]  Fixed a minor bug in lxLite - when file was already processed but
       stored with debug info and you process it again and choose to discard
       debug info it refused to do it because 'file was already processed'.
  [!]  Fixed a serious bug - the /G option in version 1.1.3 DOES NOT DO WHAT
       YOU PRESUME :-) It stored garbage instead of debug/extra data.
  [*]  The option /GX*.$x$ is used by default. This was done for those
       executables which failed to run after packing because the extra data
       has been stripped. Use COPY /B {file}.exe+{file}.x {newfile}.exe
       command to append extra LX data back - in most cases this will
       restore the functionality of LX files. Note that now lxLite leaves
       those *.$x$ files as garbage, so don't forget to test the executable
       functionality and to delete them if executable still works.
  [*]  Improved performance of ChCase - now when computed filename will
       be the same as initial file will be simply skipped.

 1.1.3
 ----- 28-May-96 fixes & changes
  [*]  Modified lxLite to redraw its progress bar only when it really changes.
       This may improve its execution speed when running it in windowed
       sessions (however I don't use them :-)
  [+]  Added option /G[X|D] which specifies an file mask for files where to
       store the e[X]tra LX data and [D]ebug info when encountered and if
       user chooses to discard it.
  [+]  The /S switch now displays the status of the /I switch also.
       This is done for those who don't believe that it always works
       (you know who you are :-)
  [-]  Removed the /O{#} option which has proven to be useless.
  [-]  Removed the old /D{+|-} switch (debug info remove on/off). Now lxLite
       prompts the user if the debug info is encountered; however the default
       behavior is to discard debug info (/YDD) as before. Now /D switch have
       other meaning (see below).
  [+]  Added (other) /D switch to set exclusion filemasks. Filemasks uses the
       same rule as OS/2 does (in fact, lxLite uses OS/2 API to do that).
       For example, /Dex*re.??e:*.zip:*.pas:*.obj will exclude these files
       from lxLite's field of view. The default configuration now includes
       the [exclude] configuration which excludes all known executables
       on which packing cannot be performed (such as PMJPEG, Watcom C etc).
       Masks should be separated by ':'; the ',' and ';' symbols can be
       present in HPFS long filenames, so they aren't taken into account.
  [+]  The /Y switch is modified (expanded). Now you can specify answers
       for each type of possible questions separately. The /Y switch must
       be followed by a letter - ID of answered question, then a letter -
       what do you want answer to be to that question. The possible IDs
       for now are:
       -----------------------------------------------------------------------
       Module is in [U]se (answers: [R]eplace, [S]kip or [A]bort);
       File contains [D]ebug info ([D]iscard, [L]eave, [S]kip or [A]bort);
       File contains e[X]tra data ([D]iscard, [L]eave, [S]kip or [A]bort);
       .[B]AK file already exists ([O]verwrite, [N]o backup, [S]kip or [A]bort);
       Confirmation (/P+) ([P]rocess, [S]kip or [A]bort);
       -----------------------------------------------------------------------
       For example, the /YUR switch will instruct lxLite always to replace
       modules which are in use. The defaults are: /YBN /YDD and /YXD.
  [+]  Added /L{#} switch to specify an [L]og file name. If no filename is
       specified, the log file will be created as lxLite.log in the same
       directory as lxLite.exe. The log file contains a list of processed
       files, their initial and final sizes, and also all problems (if any)
       which have been encountered when processing the file.

 1.1.2
 ----- 22-May-96 minor additions and changes
  [;]  The BOXER for OS/2 APAR is closed now :-) At last I downloaded it
       from hobbes and it works packed absolutely without any problems.
       This is due to the effect of 'overlayed data' for which support
       has been added in version 1.1.1.
  [+]  Added an alternative [D]iscard choice when prompting for an action
       when data out of LX structure is detected. Some DLL's (even from
       \OS2\DLL) seems to contain some garbage after end of LX file.
  [*]  Changed memory allocation strategy - now memory manager allocate
       memory in 64K chunks which can fix the problem of slow performance
       on low-memory machines (8mb and less) when processing large files
       (i.e. TUTORMRI.DLL). I can't check this - please mail me if it works.
  [*]  Changed backup strategy - now lxLite always make .BAK file even if
       backups are disabled (/B-). If operation succeeds and backups are
       disabled it is then removed. No more '$lxlite$.tmp' file.
  [*]  Now lxLite says '(very!)' in phrase
       'It is (very!) possible that resulting file will be non-functional'
       only if the size of data out of LX structure is bigger than 256 bytes
       (this can be changed by /O{#} option /see below/). If overlay size is
       bigger and /Y+ switch is specified file is skipped otherwise overlayed
       data is [D]iscarded.
  [+]  Added /O{#} option which allows to specify threshold size for overlay
       data. All overlays less than this value are discarded with /Y+ switch.
       For more information please refer to English documentation.
  [*]  Modified defaults - now lxLite by default doesn't pack using
       run-length method AT ALL (i.e. as if you specified /MRN switch).
       That is because I hadn't found even a case when using this method
       lxLite produced packed files by at least A BYTE less in size.
       Instead it compresses now A LOT faster.

 1.1.1
 ----- 07-May-96 bugfix
  [!]  noEA and chCase v1.0.0 does not work on directories - they says that
       the module is in use. Version 1.0.1 is fixed.
  [!]  lxLite, noEA, unLock and chCase leaves sometimes garbage on screen
       especially when processing long subdirectories. Fixed.

 1.1.0
 ----- 06-May-96 some additions + minor bugfix
  [*]  Change in version numeration: Now version numbers conforms to GNU
       standards. The first is major release number; second is minor release
       ordinal and third is incremented only on bug-fixes.
  [!]  Now lxLite checks for a valid MZ header in DOS executable stub.
  [!]  Fixed: lxLite stops sometimes after trying to 'pack' locked files
       (i.e. swapper.dat) with a runtime error. The cause was a bug (sic!)
       in DosEnumAttribute - when you issue it on a locked file it trashes
       memory AFTER buffer passed to it (in my cause this trashed the stack).
  [+]  Now lxLite understands quoted long complex filenames on the command
       line like most OS/2 commands do. I.e. you can write
        lxLite "my own subdirectory\my executable file.exe" /cmax
  [+]  Added option /Q - query list of configurations.
  [+]  Added option /I{+|-} - Run/don't run at idle priority
  [+]  Added detection of 'overlayed' executables (usually from Watcom) -
       for more information see English documentation.
  [+]  Added 'lxLite utility pack' which now consists of:
        - unLock which allow to unlock 'locked' executables
        - chCase which allow to automatically change case of individual
          filenames as well as of groups of filenames
        - colMng is a simple utility to manage your WPS color palettes
        - noEA which allow to remove extended attributes from files
          and directories

 1.01
 ---- 23-Feb-96 minor bugfix
  [!] Bugfix :-) in v1.00 docs I erroneously stated that Alice was born
      at 13-Feb-96; however the real date is 12-Feb-1996 :-)
  [!] Now lxLite preserves not only timestamp but also file attributes.
      The version 1.00 erroneously stated that file is used by another
      process in the case lxLite failed to access it because of read-only
      or system attribute.
  [!] Fixed: lxLite preserves now extended attributes of the file. Sometimes
      EAs are useful, although mostly occupies disk space :-)
  [!] Fixed: lxLite now COPIES file into/from backup copies instead of
      renaming them: this caused the WorkPlace Shell to track such operations
      and to change the 'program filename' field in program object.
  [*] Now /R{#} option can be used to re-align pages even on 1 (byte)
      boundary. This will get some extra bytes, however LINK386 does not
      allow this value to be less than 4 (but OS/2 eats it) - use at your
      own risk.
  [-] Removed 'Switch-to-foreground-when-asking' feature. This was
      implemented rather as a lab work than a useful feature :-)
      On the other hand, the version with this feature must use
      PMSHAPI.DLL which is not always available (in particular when
      booting from OS/2 repair/installation diskettes).

 1.00
 ---- 15-Feb-96 first release version
  [!] When an invalid page is encountered don't exit with an error but
      check first if this page is used. (Encountered on npswpsri.dll 1.81).
      This is an invalid executable; however error is not fatal because
      page isn't used and OS/2 loads that DLL without problems.
  [!] Now lxLite keeps and restores original executable timestamp.
  [!] Fixed an error when OS/2 locks up on some DOS executables because
      it contained a 0 at offset 3Ch in DOS EXE header.
  [*] Changed format of .CFG file. Now it is a plain ASCII text file. For
      details refer to documentation, section about options.
  [-] Removed /D# option - use a text editor to add new cfgs.
  [+] Added /D{+|-} option allowing to remove debug information.
  [+] Added ability to recognize files packed with ABSOLUTELY THE SAME
      options, so lxLite will not proceed the same file twice. "The same"
      means that files will be recognized as packed ONLY if it has been
      processed with the same switch(-es) which influence resulting file
      size. Use /F+ (see below) switch to bypass this detection if you
      want to process file anyway - for example if it has been already
      packed, but not so good as it can be, i.e. by LINK386 or REPACK.
  [+] Added /F{+|-} option allowing to force repacking even if lxLite
      thinks that it is not needed. Use to bypass autodetection ('already
      processed' message).
  [+] Added /T{#} option allowing to replace DOS stubs. Use /T alone to
      completely remove DOS stubs - useful for DLLs 'cause they cannot
      be run from DOS session at all.
  [+] Added ability to replace even USED! i.e. 'active' .DLL's and
      executables. Now you can repack entire \os2\*\*.* subdirectory
      without having to do a clean boot. Note that you better reboot after
      such operations because OS/2 will throw away all its internal cache
      buffers for this module and it (i.e. its old copy) will be kept
      entirely in memory/swapfile.
  [+] Now lxLite runs at the idle:16 priority so it won't overload your CPU.
  [+] Now when lxLite encounters a problem to which he needs your answer he
      brings itself to the foreground. The only thing to say about it is:
      because of that lxLite uses now PMSHAPI & PMWIN.DLL, so it most likely
      will not run under T-Shell. Because of that there are TWO supplied
      versions of lxLite: lxLite-T.exe and lxLite.exe. Delete first if you
      will not need lxLite with a clean boot.
  [+] Added /Z{#} option which defines the threshold for lxLite to separate
      programs with 'functional' stubs such as dual-mode executables from
      'dummy' stubs. Default size is 1024 bytes, i.e. on all executables with
      stub size bigger than 1024 bytes the /T{#} option will have no effect.

 0.99b
 ----- 07-Feb-96 beta-test version
  [;] What's new? Nice question :-)
