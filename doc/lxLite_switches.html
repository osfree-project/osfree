<h1>Command-line switches</h1>
 
<p> There are a lot of options in lxLite. I simply like options :-) So, you 
can configure almost anything in lxLite. Moreover, to protect the user from 
need of writing the same options lxLite support multiple configurations which 
are kept in a single file. lxLite comes with some example configurations (`factory
defaults`) which are listed below: </p>
 
<hr> 
<dl>
  <dt>default (loaded by default) </dt>
  <dd>It is a `work` configuration. All parameters are set to optimal level
of compression without too much effort applied. File backup is disabled except
for files that have extra data after LX structure. Note that this configuration
is ALWAYS loaded before any other options are in effect, so even /C{#} option
is executed AFTER default configuration is loaded. </dd>
  <dt>unpack (loaded for /X option) </dt>
  <dd>This configuration is loaded when you request to unpack the file (/X).
By default it is empty; you can add here everything you want to happen when 
files are unpacked. </dd>
  <dt>ver2x </dt>
  <dd>Optimal for pre-Warp versions of OS/2. Versions before Warp (3.0) does
not know of the Lempel-Ziv (/EXEPACK:2) method. DON`T PACK EXECUTABLES WITH 
LEMPEL-ZIV`s ALGORITHM if there is a chance to run your program on OS/2 v2.xx
(except 2.99). </dd>
  <dt>max </dt>
  <dd>Tightest compression level. VERY SLOW! It is rarely needed to use this 
configuration. </dd>
  <dt>newStub </dt>
  <dd>This is a particular configuration used to replace one DOS stub in
LX executable by another without altering anything else. You have to specify 
a filename for new stub - this configuration only tells lxLite not to depack
old objects and not to pack unpacked objects. </dd>
  <dt>minStub </dt>
  <dd>This is a configuration which is linked to newStub and replaces stubs
in given files by minimal possible stub of `say-error-and-exit` type. You 
cannot make it smaller (at least I doubt it), only if you shorten the error 
message. </dd>
  <dt>vdmStub </dt>
  <dd>This configuration tells lxLite to replace in specified files stub
by a `run-from-VDM`-style one. This is also as short as possible :-) Please 
read the /T{#} option description for further details. </dd>
  <dt>info </dt>
  <dd>Use this configuration to get the most important information about executables
(see option /V) without altering them. </dd>
  <dt>exehdr </dt>
  <dd>Shows complete information about the executable header. Module file
is not altered in any way. </dd>
  <dt>exemap </dt>
  <dd>Shows anything about the executable structure. This can generate sometimes 
very long data sheets, so use it only if really needed. </dd>
  <dt>map </dt>
  <dd>Shows the memory map of the executable: memory objects and pages which 
makes the object. </dd>
  <dt>exp </dt>
  <dd>Shows everything that is exported from the module (exported names and 
exported entriy points) </dd>
  <dt>imp </dt>
  <dd>Shows module import tables </dd>
  <dt>pdd </dt>
  <dd>This configuration can be used for physical device drivers (especially
in NE format). </dd>
  <dt>dll </dt>
  <dd>This configuration is useful for dynamic-link libraries. </dd>
</dl>
 
<hr> 
<p> To use a specific configuration use the /C:# switch where # is configuration`s
identifier. Settings are loaded from file lxLite.CFG in the same directory
where lxLite.EXE resides. You shouldn`t care about paths - lxLite will always
find it. For example, to use `max` configuration run lxLite /c:Max. For a
detailed description of .CFG file format see section right below the following. 
</p>
 
<p> Here is a detailed explanation of what each switch does. Note that any 
switch which accepts '+' or '-' sign after it (to enable/disable the action 
which switch symbolizes) can be used without anything after it - this is accepted
as '+'. For example, /V+ is equivalent to /V. </p>
 
<hr> 
<dl>
  <dt><b>/A[{P|S|N{P|S}}{:#}]</b> </dt>
  <dd>Set alignment method for first and rest of objects. First object can
be aligned on [P]age shift, [S]ector or [N]o boundary. Note that the last 
option (No boundary) cannot be achieved by using LINK386, but it works well,
and the LX format allows it. All objects except first MUST be aligned on
at least PageShift boundary. PageShift is a value that is specified in LX
header. You can redefine it too by specifying a semicolon and a decimal value
after it: for example the /APP:512 switch will place all pages in executable
on 512 bytes boundary. Note that the # value must be a power of two (i.e.
1,2,4,8,16,32,...). </dd>
  <dt><b>/B(D|X|+|-){:%}</b> </dt>
  <dd>Enable (+) or disable (-) copying original file into *.BAK; optionaly 
lxLite can do it only when [D]ebug and/or e[X]tra data are detected. Also
you can specify an directory % for backed up files (relative to root). The
entire directory tree will be re-created inside the backup directory. For
example, the /BX:c:\lxlite.bak switch will instruct lxLite to back up files
only when e[X]tra data is present in module and to place them into the directory
structure under the c:\lxlite.bak directory. </dd>
  <dt><b>/C{S}{+|-}</b> </dt>
  <dd>Enable (+) or disable (-) colored output. You can specify {S} to force 
lxLite to use StdOut instead of VioXXX functions. </dd>
  <dt><b>/C[:%]</b> </dt>
  <dd>Use configuration with ID = %; The two predefined configuration names
are "default" and "unpack". First is always loaded as lxLite starts and second
is used when /X+ option is specified (this is NOT equivalent to /c:Unpack). 
  </dd>
  <dt><b>/E{#}</b> </dt>
  <dd>Set [E]xclude filemask. All files that fits given filemask(s) will
be bypassed by lxLite. All filemasks must be separated by ':' (because it 
cannot be a part of filemask). For example /D*.zip:*.arj:*.rar switch will
instruct lxLite to avoid all .zip, .arj and .rar files. Default lxlite configuration
(/C:default) includes the /C:exclude configuration which instructs lxLite
to avoid all executables which are known to have problems when packed. Note
that the /D switches are additive, so /D*.zip /D*.arj /D*.rar is equivalent
to the example above. To clear exclusion list use specify /D. </dd>
  <dt><b>/F{+|-}</b> </dt>
  <dd>Force repacking. Use /F+ to bypass `already processed` message, i.e. 
when lxLite thinks that file was already processed and it really wasn`t. This
usually doesn`t happen, but can happen when you try to replace a stub by
another of the same size in a already packed file. </dd>
  <dt><b>/I{+|-}</b> </dt>
  <dd>Force (+) lxLite to run at idle priority. This mean that lxLite will
do its work only when no other activity in system occurs (waiting for an keyboard/mouse
event etc). This is the best in my opinion choice because you can run lxLite
in background and it will not degrade almost at all system performance. However
if you`ll run an `badly-behaved` VDM session which grabs all CPU time lxLite
will completely stop. When run with /I- option lxLite does not changes its
priority (i.e. you can run lxLite /I- via priority.exe program which starts
programs with given priority). </dd>
  <dt><b>/J[A|E|L|P|V](E|L|P|V|N|X|+|-)</b> </dt>
  <dd>Change module type: Leave [A]s-is, [E]xecutable module, [L]ibrary module, 
[P]hysical or [V]irtual driver. Especially useful when converting NE drivers.
Optionaly you can restrict this to work only on [E]xecutables, [L]ibraries,
[P]hysical or [V]irtual drivers, [N]E or L[X] executables and any combination
of them. [N]E and [L]X conditions are considered with an AND operator; all
others with OR, i.e. /JPELN will mean: "Change module type into [P]hysical
device driver for all [E]xecutables OR [L]ibraries which also are (AND) [N]E
modules" </dd>
  <dt><b>/L(A|S|U|+|-){:%}</b> </dt>
  <dd>Instructs lxLite to maintain an log file. If no file name is specified, 
lxLite.log is used in the home directory of lxLite. Beside the filename, the
start and final file size is written into log along with the problems (if
any) that were encountered when processing (for example: 'Executable has
been used by another process and replaced'). You can also optionaly choose
to log either [S]uccessful or [U]nsuccessful cases or [A]ll (which means
more than just /SU+: lxLite will also log 'already processed' files). </dd>
  <dt><b>/M[R[N|1|2|3]|L[N|1]|F[N|1|2]]</b> </dt>
  <dd>Set packing method &amp; parameters. Second character (after M) defines
the method to set-up: `R` stands for run-length (/EXEPACK:1), 'L' for Lempel-Ziv
(/EXEPACK:2) and 'F' for Fixup packing method. The third character is the
level of compression using that method; if N is specified the method is disabled.
Three levels of packing are provided for run-length compression. The level
1 is the fastest. It searches only for 1-character strings. For example,
the 'AAAAAAAA' string will be detected and packed as 8, 1, 'A' while 'ABABABAB'
string will be stored as unpacked text. Level 2 detects repeated strings
of up to 16 characters length, so the example above will be encoded as 4,2,'AB'. 
This is the default setting for most 'factory` configurations. And last, 3rd
level searchs for ALL strings of any length (up to page size/2 = 2048). This
compreses VERY slow and seldom gives real results, so use it only when you
really need it. The Lempel-Ziv algorithm can be either disabled (/MLN) or
enabled (/ML1). When enabled it searchs for all matches using a relatively
fast hash-table, so there is no need in gradations by compression speed.
The fixup packing method can be set to [N]one, level 1 end level 2; fixups
packed using Level 1 are recognized by any OS/2 version above 2.x; however
level 2 compressed fixups will work only in OS/2 Warp 3.0 with (fixpack #17
(I believe)) and above (Warp 4.0 too). Note that when /MF1 or /MF2 is in
use, the /U{+|-} option is ignored - module is always unpacked first. </dd>
  <dt><b>/N(B|L|A|+|-)</b> </dt>
  <dd>[N]E executables: convert into LX (+) or reject (-) modules that are 
[B]ound, not [L]FN-aware or [A]ll. For more information about [B] and [L]
option see the 'Features' section above. For example, the /NA- option will
instruct lxLite not to convert NE files into LX, the /NA+ will instruct to
convert always; the /NA-LB+ will instruct lxLite to convert ONLY non-[L]FN-aware
and [B]ound executables, the /NA+LB- will instruct lxLite to convert [A]ll
except non-[L]FN-aware and [B]ound executables. </dd>
  <dt><b>/O(X|D|S|A|+|-){:%}</b> </dt>
  <dd>[O]utput e[X]tra/[D]ebug/[S]tub data into an external file; filename
is determined by applying mask % onto original filename. Data is written [A]lways
in the A+ state and only when removed in the A- state. For example, the /OD:*.$d$
switch will have effect on the TEST.EXE executable which contains debug info
only when you choose to discard it and will place it into the file TEST.$d$. 
  </dd>
  <dt><b>/P{+|-}</b> </dt>
  <dd>Enable (+) or disable (-) pause before each file. The program shows
the name of file which will be processed and offers a choice to continue
or to abort. </dd>
  <dt><b>/Q{+|-}</b> </dt>
  <dd>Query all configuration options. Basically it simply types a colored 
version of lxLite.cfg file through a MORE-style filter :-) All other options
on the command line (if any) are ignored. </dd>
  <dt><b>/R{+|-}</b> </dt>
  <dd>Enable (+) or disable (-) [R]ecursive file search through subdirectories. 
  </dd>
  <dt><b>/S{+|-}</b> </dt>
  <dd>Show (+) or don`t show (-) configuration in effect. This is useful
for examining which settings are stored into .CFG file, especially for linked 
configurations (see below). For example lxLite /Cdefault /S will show the
default settings. </dd>
  <dt><b>/T{:%}</b> </dt>
  <dd>Use specified file as new DOS stub. DOS stub is (usualy) a tiny DOS
.EXE file linked to OS/2`s module which is typicaly used to type an error 
message in the case if the executable is not run from DOS command line. Usually
this looks like:<br>
 <br>
 This is an OS/2 executable module<br>
 <br>
 Along with lxLite are enclosed two stubs: stub_min.bin and stub_vdm.bin. 
First is the standard `type-error-and-exit` type, but it is slightly smaller
than usual stubs used by various linkers. The second is an stub which starts
a new OS/2 session and runs program from it again. If OS/2 is not detected
it types the same error message and exits. The default for stub_vdm.bin is
to let OS/2 decide the type of your executable itself. Alternatively, you
can specify the type of session to be started by stub_vdm.bin. For this you
need any hex editor - find the pattern `SesType-&gt;' in stub and replace
the byte that comes after arrow (-&gt;) by needed session type. OS/2 recognizes
next session types: 
    <ul>
 <li>00 - OS/2 session manager determines type (default) </li>
      <li>01 - OS/2 full-screen session </li>
      <li>02 - OS/2 windowed session </li>
      <li>03 - PM application </li>
      <li>04 - VDM full-screen session </li>
      <li>07 - VDM windowed session </li>
    </ul>
 
    <p> You can use stubs to do some neat tricks. Say you have two executables: 
ZIP for OS/2 and ZIP for DOS (I mean GNU ZIP, not PKZIP). They offer the same
interface, does the same thing and share the same name. To avoid conflicts
(and avoid placing them in different directories) you can link them both
together into one EXE file which can be ran either from DOS or OS/2 mode.
This can be achieved by following command line: </p>
 <cite>lxLite /t:dos\zip.exe os2\zip.exe</cite> 
    <p> If stub size is bigger than certain threshold size (default - 1024
bytes) it will not be replaced. This is done since stubs of bigger size usualy 
does something useful (for example, this can be already an 'dual-mode' executable).
It is useful for batch conversions and not too useful when you do tricks
like described above: so you can wish to change this threshold value to zero.
This can be achieved using the /Z switch (see below for details). </p>
 </dd>
  <dt><b>/U{+|-}</b> </dt>
  <dd>Enable (+) or disable (-) unpacking file before packing. lxLite know
how to unpack any of two packing methods described, so default option state 
is enabled. Disable it only when compression time savings are more important
than disk space savings. This option is ignored (and file is anyway unpacked)
when /MF2 packing is enabled. </dd>
  <dt><b>/V[{0123OCRNMPEFXD}{+|-}]</b> </dt>
  <dd>[V]erbose (show a lot of file information).<br>
 This is a switch for curious ones :-) It has different levels of verbosity,

        <pre>+ Indx + Entry Type + Entry Attributes ---------------------<br>| 0005 |    0:32    | 1:00000000, Exported, Shared Data<br>| 000B |    0:32    | 1:00008C90, Exported, Shared Data<br>| 000C |    0:32    | 1:00008FB4, Exported, Shared Data<br>| 002B |    16:16   | 4:02EC, Exported, Shared Data<br>| 002E |    0:32    | 1:00009468, Exported, Shared Data<br>+ 0056 +    0:32    + 1:00001448, Exported, Shared Data<br></pre>
 
        <dl>
          <dt>Indx </dt>
          <dd>Index into the entry table. Entry table is always sequential,
and all 'holes' between indices are filled with 'unused' entry points (for
example, entry point index 10 cannot follow index 5: there must be entries
6,7,8,9 between them marked as 'unused'). lxLite doesn`t show 'unused' entries
since this is unuseful; however they are there, just for your information. 
          </dd>
          <dt>Entry Type </dt>
          <dd>Type of entry point. Entry points can be located in different 
segments (16-bit, 32-bit, it can be an Call Gate etc), so OS/2 needs a flag
which will describe how to handle each entry point. There are also "forwarders"
- fake entry points into the module which are in fact redirected into another
module. For example, PMWIN.DLL, PMGPI.DLL and many other DLLs are simply
a bunch of forwarders which all points to PMMERGE.DLL. </dd>
          <dt>Entry Attributes </dt>
          <dd>These depends of the entry type. For example, 0:32 entries
has Object:Offset32 attribute, 16:16 entries have Object:Offset16 attribute,
forwarders have attributes which describe to which module and which procedure
to redirect this entry etc. </dd>
        </dl>
 </li>
      <li>F<br>
 [F]ixup table. This is useful, I think, only for me and, may be, for those
who write compilers :-) Display format: 
        <pre>+ Object index: 1 Page index: 1 Absolute page: 1<br>| 32-bit relative offset of import SETLOC1.4<br>| 045C 0494 04B8<br>| 32-bit relative offset of import SETLOC1.5<br>| 035F 0CBA<br>[.....................]<br>+ Object index: 1 Page index: 2 Absolute page: 2<br>| 32-bit relative offset of import SETLOC1.4<br>| 02B6 0328 0354 090E<br>[.....................]<br>+ Object index: 1 Page index: 42 Absolute page: 42<br>| 32-bit relative offset of import DOSCALLS.256(DosSetFilePtr)<br>| 066F 0C5D 0CD5<br>| 32-bit relative offset of import DOSCALLS.272(DosSetFileSize)<br>| 0CB2<br>| 32-bit relative offset of import DOSCALLS.273(DosOpen)<br>| 0B9D<br>[.....................]<br></pre>
 Imports by ordinals are handled in a special way: lxLite has a resource table
which contains information which allows lxLite to transform MODULE:ORDINAL
form into an MODULE:NAME pair. By default lxLite contains a list of ordinals
for all base OS/2 DLL`s, but if you want to add your own or if you need something
special, you can add your module entries to lxLite.rc file in the API subdirectory
and then to re-attach resources to lxLite (using Resource Compiler). </li>
      <li>X<br>
 Always inform about e[X]tra data contained in module (in spite of /ZX{:#}
setting). </li>
      <li>D<br>
 Always inform about [D]ebug info contained in module (in spite of /ZD{:#}
setting). </li>
    </ul>
 </dd>
  <dt><b>/W(W|S|+|-)</b> </dt>
  <dd>[W]rite (+) or [S]imulate writing of resulting file. In the /WW- state 
lxLite will do nothing (useful for /V option); in the /WS+ state lxLite will
even display compression ratio, but won`t alter the module file on disk.
Useful for /V{...} switch, but also can be useful for debugging your options. 
  </dd>
  <dt><b>/X{+|-}</b> </dt>
  <dd>e[X]pand (+) or pack (-) given files. Use this switch to decompress
files. lxLite can decompress files which has been compressed by itself as
well as by other programs which uses standard methods (i.e. Resource Compiler,
LINK386, REPACK). It is NOT identical to /c:Unpack option. </dd>
  <dt><b>/Y[U|X|B|C|D]{?}</b> </dt>
  <dd>auto-repl[Y] '?' on one of questions: 
    <ul>
 <li> file in [U]se /Answer: [R]eplace, [S]kip, [A]bort/ </li>
      <li> [D]ebug info in file /Answer: [D]iscard, [L]eave, [S]kip, [A]bort/ 
      </li>
      <li> e[X]tra data in file /[D]iscard, [L]eave, [S]kip, [A]bort/ </li>
      <li> [B]ackup file exists /[O]verwrite, [N]o backup, [S]kip, [A]bort/ 
      </li>
      <li> [C]onfirmation on /P+ /[P]rocess, [S]kip, [A]bort/ </li>
    </ul>
 If reply (?) is missing, lxLite will ask you interactively each time. When 
lxLite asks you a question, you can press Alt+letter which will set the default
answer for all following similar questions. </dd>
  <dt><b>/Z[X|D|S{:#}]</b> </dt>
  <dd>This option sets the `threshold` si[Z]e for e[X]tra, [D]ebug, or [S]tub
data contained in the module. If size is under givenšthreshold then the data
is discarded. When {:#} is ommited, threshold is considered VERY big.</dd>
  <dd>In stub case this option helps lxLite to determine whether the stub
is a `dummy` one, or it is a functional program. There are a number of programs
(for example, \os2\xdfloppy.exe) which runs both under DOS and OS/2 - in
such programs DOS executable is implemented into OS/2`s LX as a DOS stub.
By default lxLite considers all stubs bigger than 1024 bytes as functional
programs, and therefore for such executables the /T{:%} option has no effect.
If you want stub to be always replaced, use the /ZS option. If you want to
disable the /T option, use /ZS:-1. </dd>
  <dt><b>/?,/H</b> </dt>
  <dd>Show a brief help. This is useful when you forget a particular switch 
from all that list :-) </dd>
