This is the Genode source repository for osFree OS/2 personality.
To build the osFree OS/2 personality under Genode, you should
checkout Genode sources first (we assume you are in "osfree" directory now):

Go to the parent directory:

! cd ..

Main Genode source repo:

! mkdir genode
! cd genode
! git clone https://github.com/genodelabs/genode.git .

Genode World repo (optional community-contributed components of Genode):

! cd repos
! mkdir world
! cd world
! git clone https://github.com/genodelabs/genode-world.git .

Go to the "genode" dir

! cd ../..

Create a Genode build directory:

! ./tool/create_builddir x86_32
! cd build/x86_32

Here we are creating the build directory for x86_32 arch. There is a number
of different platforms supported, like Linux kernel, Fiasco, Fiasco.OC, Nova,
seL4, OKL4, HW etc. Most of them support both x86_32 and x86_64.

Then edit etc/build.conf:

uncomment the

#MAKE += -j4

line and change -j4 to -j2 if you have a two-core machine (for a parallel build). If you
don't want parallel building, leave this line commented out.

Set default kernel to "linux" (uncomment the following line)

# KERNEL=linux

Now you have a minimal set of code repos enabled. Start the build process:

! make

When everything is built, you can test the "Demo" scenario:

! make run/demo

The SDL window should appear which shows the Scout documentation browser. You can follow
the directions in the Scout window.

You can change the kernel by specifying e.g., KERNEL=nova on the command line:

! make KERNEL=nova run/demo

When the demo scenario works, you could build osFree then. For that, you will need to go to
build/x86_32/etc/build.conf file and uncomment the "libports", "ports" source repositories, and
then add the "os3" repository (add two lines like this at some place in etc/build.conf):

REPOSITORIES += $(GENODE_DIR)/repos/os3

You'll also need to create an "os3" symlink in "genode/repos" subdirectory to Genode-
specific subdirectory of OS/2 personality sources:

! cd genode/repos
! ln -s <path_to_osfree_sources>/OS2/Server/platform/genode os3
! cd os3
! ln -s <path_to_osfree_sources>/OS2/Server shared

Here we created the "os3" symlink to Genode-specific source tree of OS/2 personality, and
then created the "shared" symlink to shared (platform-independent) sources.

Note that repos order does matter. Repos are searched in the order they are specified in
etc/build.conf. Usually, I add the OS3 repo after "Optional repositories" line.

The "libports" (and, probably, "ports" too) are needed because osFree needs libc. Genode
uses libc ported from FreeBSD. So, you'll need to prepare the "libc" port first:

# cd ../..

You're now in the "genode" directory. Now run the following command:

# ./tool/ports/prepare_port libc

This will download the FreeBSD libc, and apply Genode-specific patches.

Then go to the genode/build/x86_32 directory:

# cd genode/build/x86_32

Start osFree scenario build by:

# make run/os2

This should build all osFree OS/2 personality components and run it under Genode/Linux.

<add a note about how to run Genode via VNC or X11 remote connection>
