osFree OS/2 Server for L4/Fiasco microkernel using L4Env

This directory contains OS/2 Server prototype by osFree project.
Logic of os2server is folowing:
1. It loads config.sys file using file provider
2. Parses config.sys
3. Executes task using PROTSHELL variabla

After this server goes to server loop. Only one library in OS/2
personality allowed to access OS2Server. It is libkal.so.
libkal.so is only one ELF format binary in OS/2 Personality.
Next upper level library (low level for any OS/2 application)
is DOSCALLS.DLL which in LX format already. May be in future
we will support ELF format executables in OS/2 Personality but
this is not main task for now.
