<B>&xwp; 0.9.9 (April 8, 2001)</B>

<P>New features:
<UL><LI>Added detailed <A HREF="095plugins.html">documentation for &xcenter; plugins</A>
plus the "toolkit" directory with the binary release.
<P><LI>Added replacement <A HREF="file_8autorefresh.html">folder auto-refresh</A>.
<P><LI>&xcenter; remembers fonts and colors for main &xcenter; painting also.
<P><LI>&xcenter;s can be enlarged vertically now with the mouse.
<P><LI>Widgets can now be dragged within their &xcenter; to allow reordering them.
<P><LI>Added delay setting for &xcenter; auto-hide.
<P><LI>"Pulse" widget now displays IRQ load as well.
<P><LI>Added "Sentinel" widget.
<P><LI>fonz contributed the "Disk Usage" widget.
<P><LI>Stefan Milcke contributed the "Health" widget.
<P><LI>Object button widgets can display WPS context menus now... sort of.
<P><LI>Added "Run" command to X-Button widget.
<P><LI>Pressing "Shift+Delete" in a folder performs a "true delete" now, if enabled.
<P><LI>Added replacement "Types" page for data files, plus replacement "Associations"
page for programs and program files, which now display the extended file types correctly.
<P><LI>File types can now be renamed on "File types" page in "Workplace Shell".
<P><LI>Added "Unknown only" checkbox to "Import WPS filters" dialog to hide known
WPS filters.
<P><LI>New settings for MB3 clicks on "Mouse mappings" page 2. Thanks, Martin Lafaix.
<P><LI>MB3 drag scrolling has nice icons and pointers now. Thanks, Martin Lafaix.
<P><LI>Added "Threads" page to XWPSetup.
<P><LI>Martin Lafaix added more pages to the settings notebooks of program files.
<P><LI>Paul Ratcliffe reworked the startup folders so that several of them may
exist and you can set for each of them individually whether they should be processed
on each Desktop restart or after bootup only.
<P><LI>"Partitions" button in XShutdown "Reboot actions" dialog finally works with
LVM too.
<P><LI>Now allowing XShutdown power-off with APM 1.1 also. Use at your own risk; if
it ain't working, don't blame me.
<P><LI>Fixed xfix, which contained a number of embarrasing bugs and therefore crashed
all the time.

</UL>Miscellaneous changes:
<UL><LI>&xwp; is finally compiled with Pentium optimizations. I had always feared
that this would break the code for 386 and 486 processors, but the VAC documentation
clearly says this is not so. If this information is incorrect, please notify me,
if you can still reach your system.
<P><LI>Reworked WarpIN installation so that class registration and object creation
is deferred until the Desktop restarts. This should fix the various upgrade problems
many people had. Besides, WarpIN supports uninstalling programs now, so the &xwp;
objects can now be deleted on uninstall too. &xwp; now requires WarpIN V0.9.9 though.
<P><LI>Worked some more on the standard &xcenter; widgets.
<P><LI>Moved "Screen corners" page from XWPMouse to XWPScreen, where it seems more
logical.
<P><LI>Reworked &pgr; settings pages in XWPScreen. Thanks, Martin Lafaix.
<P><LI>Per popular request, the "Duplicates" window on the "System paths" page in
"OS/2 Kernel" is now non-modal. Besides, an "Edit" button and more system paths
have been added. Thanks, Paul Ratcliffe.
<P><LI>Reworked the trash can to use a mappings file for the hidden subdirectories
of the "\TRASH" directories on each drive. This should finally solve the problems
with the "File exists" dialog popping up all the time. Besides, this should avoid
the excessive creation of WPS file handles that used to occur for the "deep paths"
that were used earlier.
<P><LI><I>Dramatically</I> sped up trash can populate on first open after Desktop startup.
<P><LI>Added several internal caches for the extended data file associations.
This <I>dramatically</I> speeds up populating folders with many files. Looks like
the extended file assocs are now even faster than the standard WPS assocs.
<P><LI>Auto-hide mouse in the XWP hook now reacts to mouse clicks too.
<P><LI>The XWP hook now allows multiple objects on the same hotkey. If you have found
out how to do it, go ahead. Otherwise don't. Thanks, Paul Ratcliffe.
<P><LI>Changed the prototype for the "init" export of &xcenter; plug-in DLLs so that
widgets can easily know about their own HMODULE.
<P><LI>Font settings weren't respected by "Import WPS filters" dialog.
<P><LI>Further optimized string routines.
<P><LI>Reworked large parts of XShutdown to get rid of several race conditions and
improper sequencing between the two shutdown threads. Also, the saving of Desktop objects
was reworked because the old routines simply dumped all abstracts to disk... which
excluded non-folders that had changes pending in the WPS background threads. All
such pending changes should now be properly detected.

</UL>Bugfixes:
<UL><LI>Fixed problems if the trash can did not have the &lt;XWP_TRASHCAN&gt; ID.
<P><LI>Fixed a problem with internal list notifications on object delete. Thanks,
Martin Lafaix. Optimized lists also to cause less INI accesses.
<P><LI>Deleting the font folder or trash can caused hundreds of stupid WPS
"cannot delete object" message boxes to pop up. Oh my, this infinite wisdom of the WPS.
Fixed, the transient objects are now quietly nuked.
<P><LI>"Delete" from folder menu bar crashed. Fixed by Paul Ratcliffe.
<P><LI>Global "Menu bar" setting in folder "View" submenu was sometimes queried wrong.
Fixed.
<P><LI>Fixed (I hope) infinitely growing swapper with &xwp; "Create another"
menu items from config folder (as mentioned in readme for quite a while)... I tested
this and it appears to work now.
<P><LI>Deleting the config folder would sometimes lead to WPS crashes. Should be
fixed now; added another mutex for protecting the config folder cache.
<P><LI>Fixed problems with &xcenter; closing on shutdown and Desktop restart. This was
several problems actually... a race condition during XShutdown, and improper thread
termination with the timers. The separate timer thread has been removed.
<P><LI>Dragging objects on &xcenter; bar caused them to always appear on the left. Fixed,
they are now properly added to the right.
<P><LI>&xcenter; settings view sometimes appeared on the &xcenter; view thread, which
wasn't such a good idea. This is now redirected to thread 1.
<P><LI>Some &xcenter; default values were reported wrong in its setup string. Fixed by
Paul Ratcliffe.
<P><LI>Widgets drag'n'drop on "Widgets" settings page got badly confused with the widget
order at times. Fixed.
<P><LI>"Pulse" widget broke CPU counters on close. Fixed.
<P><LI>"Undo" and "Default" on &xcenter; settings pages never worked. Fixed.
<P><LI>"Undo" and "Default" also had problems on several hook-related pages. Fixed
by Martin Lafaix.
<P><LI>Fixed object hotkey entry fields so that "Set" and "Clear" can still be
accessed with the keyboard. Made "Folder hotkeys" page behave like "Object" page.
<P><LI>Object count on "Status" page in XWPSetup went below zero sometimes. Fixed by
Paul Ratcliffe.
<P><LI>Sliding menus sometimes caused a flickering focus if delay was enabled and
user clicked on menu item before delay elapsed. Fixed.
<P><LI>Fixed "conditional cascade sensitivity" for sliding menus to always hilite
the menu item but only open the submenu if mouse is over the menu button.
<P><LI>Fixed bad system hangs when "File exists" replacement was enabled. This was
mostly caused by deadlocks between several WPS mutexes. Also the new dialog hung
the system with certain file names.
<P><LI>Priority change of the Worker thread never worked if the Worker message queue
got filled with too many messages. Fixed.
<P><LI>Completely reworked tracking of awake objects by the Worker thread. All
awake objects are now tracked (check the "Status" page in XWPSetup), and performance
is still much better than previously.
<P><LI>"Shutdown" etc. menu items weren't disabled on &xcenter; X-button if shutdown
was already running. Desktop "Shutdown" menu item wasn't either if submenu was disabled.
