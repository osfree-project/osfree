<!-- V0.9.1: this page is all new with V0.9.1. Its contents have been extracted
             from the old "xices_30wpsstrings.html" page. -->
<!-- V0.9.16: this page is no longer active since all setup string info was
             moved to the HLP file. If you have translated this page already,

<B>Class: XFolder</B><HR>
The following setup strings can be used the same way as the regular folder setup strings
described on the <A HREF="xices_30wpsstrings.html">previous page</A>;
however, they work only when XFolder is properly installed.

<DL>
<DT><CODE><B>ACCELERATORS</B>={YES|NO|DEFAULT}</CODE>
<DD>Sets for an individual folder whether it will respond to folder hotkeys.
This setting corresponds to the one on the "XFolder" notebook settings page.
YES or NO will set this setting for this folder no matter what was specified in the
global settings, while DEFAULT will set this setting to the global value.
See <A HREF="fldr_5xelerators.html">"Folder hotkeys"</A> for details.

<P><DT><CODE><B>ALWAYSSORT</B>={YES|NO|DEFAULT}</CODE>
<DD>Sets for an individual folder whether it will always maintain its sort order.
As opposed to the <A HREF="xices_30wpsstrings.html">standard WPS folder setup string</A>,
XFolder's new interpretation also accepts "DEFAULT" as a parameter, which will reset
the setting to what you specified on the "Sort" page in the "System" object.

<P><DT><CODE><B>DEFAULTSORT</B>=<I>crit</I></CODE>
<DD>This will set the default sort criterion for an individual folder to something
different from the global sort criterion.
<!-- V0.9.12: the following has been rewritten -->
<CODE><I>crit</I></CODE> may be one of the following:
<BR><CODE>  -1   </CODE>sort by type
<BR><CODE>  -2   </CODE>sort by name
<BR><CODE>  -3   </CODE>sort by object class
<BR><CODE>  -4   </CODE>sort by file name extension
<BR><CODE>  255  </CODE>reset to global default sort criterion
<P>Note that depending on the folder sort class, values between 0 and 100 may also
be supported. Those values correspond to the indices of object details columns
in Details view and are class-specific. Experiment with with the setup string values
reported in a folder's settings notebook.
<!-- end V0.9.12 -->

<P><DT><CODE><B>FAVORITEFOLDER</B>={YES|NO}</CODE>
<DD>Sets for an individual folder whether its contents can be viewed from
all context menus on your system.
This setting corresponds to the one on the "XFolder" notebook settings page.
Default is NO. There is no global value for this setting.
See <A HREF="menu_6favorite.html">"Folder content functions"</A> for details.

<P><DT><CODE><B>FULLPATH</B>={YES|NO|DEFAULT}</CODE>
<DD>Sets for an individual folder whether its full path will be displayed in its window title.
This setting corresponds to the one on the "XFolder" notebook settings page.
YES or NO will set this setting for this folder no matter what was specified in the
global settings, while DEFAULT will set this setting to the global value.
See <A HREF="fldr_2fullpath.html">"Full path in window titles"</A> for details.

<!-- V0.9.9: added QUICKOPEN -->
<P><DT><CODE><B>QUICKOPEN</B>={YES|NO|IMMEDIATE}</CODE>
<DD>Sets for an individual folder whether it will be pre-populated on Desktop startup.
This setting corresponds to the one on the "XFolder" notebook settings page.
YES or NO will set this setting for this folder.
Default is NO. There is no global value for this setting.
See <A HREF="fldr_5quickopen.html">"Quick-open folders"</A> for details.
<P>As a special command, <CODE>QUICKOPEN=IMMEDIATE</CODE> will populate the folder
immediately. This can be used in a REXX script to force population of a folder without
having to open it. As a result, <CODE>QUICKOPEN=IMMEDIATE</CODE> is no setting, but
rather a command to be performed on a folder.

<P><DT><CODE><B>SNAPTOGRID</B>={YES|NO|DEFAULT|EXEC}</CODE>
<DD>Sets for an individual folder whether the "Snap to grid" item will appear
in the folder's context menu.
This setting corresponds to the one on the "XFolder" notebook settings page.
YES or NO will set this setting for this folder no matter what was specified in the
global settings, while DEFAULT will set this setting to the global value.
EXEC will execute the "Snap to grid" function on the folder, just as if you had
selected it from the context menu. EXEC is thus no setting, but a command to be performed
on a folder.
See <A HREF="menu_8snaptogrid.html">"Snap to grid"</A> for details.

<!-- V0.9.12: added this -->
<P><DT><CODE><B>SORTFOLDERSFIRST</B>={YES|NO|DEFAULT}</CODE>
<DD>Sets for an individual folder whether folders will always be sorted in first.
This setting corresponds to the one on the folder's "Sort" notebook settings page.
YES or NO will set this setting for this folder no matter what was specified in the
global settings, while DEFAULT will set this setting to the global value.
<!-- end V0.9.12 -->

<P><DT><CODE><B>SORTNOW</B>=<I>crit</I></CODE>
<DD>This will sort all currently open views of an individual folder without changing
a folder's setting (as opposed to <CODE>DEFAULTSORT</CODE>). This is not really a
"setting", but rather a command to be performed on a folder.
<CODE><I>crit</I></CODE> has the same meaning as with <CODE>DEFAULTSORT</CODE>.

<P><DT><CODE><B>STATUSBAR</B>={YES|NO|DEFAULT}</CODE>
<DD>Sets the visibility state for an individual folder status bar.
This setting corresponds to the one on the "XFolder" notebook settings page.
YES or NO will set this setting for this folder no matter what was specified in the
global settings, while DEFAULT will set this setting to the global value.
See <A HREF="stat_1intro.html">"Folder status bars"</A> for details.
