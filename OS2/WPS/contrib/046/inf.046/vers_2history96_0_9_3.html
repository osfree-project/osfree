<B>&xwp; 0.9.3 (June 5, 2000)</B>

<P>New features:
<UL><LI>Added CMDREF.INF support to "Drivers" page in "OS/2 Kernel".
<P><LI>Added configuration support for original IBM1S506.ADD.
<P><LI>Added help to "Drivers" page and IBM1S506.ADD/DANIS506.ADD dialog.
<P><LI>Added "&pgr;" configuration pages to "Screen" object. Added more colors
to be configurable.
<P><LI>Added <A HREF="mouse_82funckeys.html">"function key" support.</A>
<P><LI>Added a new system sound for "hotkey pressed". Found a nice sound for this
in my library too. If this doesn't show up in your
"Sound" object, disable and enable system sounds once in XWPSetup, and answer "Yes" twice
to the questions whether system sounds should be removed and installed.
<P><LI>Implemented arrow hotkeys for quick &pgr; desktop switching.
<P><LI>Added new "Paranoia" setting for disabling the more advanced XFolder menu functions,
in case these still don't work right somewhere.
<P><LI>Major rework of the XWP file operations engine. Added "True delete" support
(Shift + delete).
Proper error handling and progress display for folders containing other objects.
Trash can can finally delete subfolders with read-only files.
<P><LI>Implemented confirmations for trash object destruction.
<P><LI>Added error explanation to "Drive not ready" dialog.
<P><LI>Updated bm-lvm.cmd by Nenad Milenkovic.
<P><LI>Shutdown animation can now be enabled for reboots too.

</UL>Miscellaneous changes:
<UL><LI>Removed "HPFS" page from "OS/2 Kernel" since we have a "Configure" dialog on the
"Drivers" page also.
<P><LI>Made "Syslevels" container a bit larger.
<P><LI>Folder "BACKGROUND" setup string now returns the boot drive as "?:\" to make it
portable.
<P><LI>Added better error management to trash can file processing. When deleting files
from non-supported drives, you'll get prompted whether the file should be "really"
deleted instead of just complaining.
<P><LI>Sped up populating trash can which was kinda slow because of excessive repaints,
especially in Details view.
<P><LI>Reworked multimedia. Added new Media thread responsible for playing sounds and
such. SOUND.DLL is gone, finally; found a better way of doing this, thanks to a hint
by Achim HasenmÅller.
<P><LI>Dramatically sped up &pgr; window movement.
<P><LI>Moved some more folder message processing code out of my exception handlers
so I don't get blamed for crashes in the default WPS processing.
<P><LI>Added SYM parsing in exception handlers for Warp 3 and Aurora UNI kernels.
<P><LI>Added new memory heap debugging system for debug builds.

</UL>Bugfixes:
<UL><LI>Network drives refused to open if "Replace drive not ready" was enabled.
Hope to have fixed that now.
<P><LI>Mouse mappings page 2 wasn't showing "Page 2/2". Fixed.
<P><LI>"WPS Class List" got confused with open windows and views so that folder views
got closed when the class list view got closed. Fixed.
<P><LI>Disabling "Snap to grid" in "&xwp; Setup" had no effect on context menus. Fixed.
<P><LI>ICONSHADOWCOLOR setup string was reported as TREESHADOWCOLOR. Fixed.
<P><LI>Completely reworked folder subclassing management (see src/folder/fdrsubcl.c).
After two years, I have finally come up with a new way of storing folder data, which
replaces the old ugly routines which have been in XFolder/&xwp; forever. I hope
this doesn't conflict with Object Desktop.
Hope that this fixes the "no folder close" problem which everybody experiences
irregularily from time to time.
<P><LI>A timer which was started at Desktop startup was never stopped. Unfortunately, that
timer's responsibility was to destroy the "Archiving" status window. Since the timer
kept running, it kept trying to destroy that window, which resulted in random windows
being destroyed from time to time in the WPS process... fixed that. This is maybe the
strangest bug I've ever managed to get into a piece of software, and I only found it
by accident. Duh.
<P><LI>Fixed a few quirks with invisible trash can directory management. Sometimes
the trash can left lots of empty hidden directories on the drives.
<P><LI>When "Disable startup folder once" was checked in the "Panic" dialog at startup,
the startup folder didn't even work when the context menu was used. Fixed.
<P><LI>Fixed a considerable PM resource leak with bootlogo bitmaps, which were never deleted
after creation.
<P><LI>Fixed a couple of minor memory leaks.
<P><LI>When a PM hard error window popped up while the startup folder was being processed,
the startup folder would never disappear, and neither would the boot logo. Fixed.
<P><LI>Updating open notebook pages when internal settings changed wasn't thread-safe.
Fixed.
<P><LI>"Drivers" page in "OS/2 Kernel" didn't detect non-existent drivers. Fixed.
<P><LI>Driver dialog for IBM1S506/DANIS506.ADD crashed if the driver had no parameters
at all in &cfgsys;. Fixed.
<P><LI>DRVF_NOPARAMS broke. Fixed.
<P><LI>"Dos window" replacement icon was missing a detail in 32x32 resolution. Thanks,
Alfredo whatever-your-last-name-is from Spain, for supplying a replacement.
<P><LI>"8.Helv" font wasn't set right in "Restart Desktop" confirmation dlg.
<P><LI>&pgr; kept appearing in tasklist. Fixed that, because the daemon should not
be closed.
<P><LI>Extended system sounds were played even if disabled in XWPSetup. Fixed.
<P><LI>Fixed a few quirks with daemon/hook settings, which weren't always serialized
right.
<P><LI>Virtual keys (such as function keys) didn't work as hotkeys in VIO windows.
For some reason, WM_CHAR doesn't have the KC_VIRTUALKEY flag set with VIO
sessions. Fixed that.
<P><LI>Mouse pointer was gone forever when hook was uninstalled while the mouse pointer
was hidden. Fixed.
<P><LI>Fixed the problems with sliding focus combo-boxes closing all the time.
<P><LI>Fixed the problems with sliding focus and frames within frames (VIEW.EXE). You
can now even slide between subframes of a main frame. ;-)
<P><LI>Invoking XShutdown via launchpad broke with V0.9.0. Fixed.
<P><LI>Fixed a few quirks at the end of shutdown, which prevented the system from displaying
the animation and/or end box right.
