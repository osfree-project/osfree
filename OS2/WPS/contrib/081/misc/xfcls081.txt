//     Each class must be given one line in this file. The first
//     word must be the class name (case-sensitive!), the second
//     word must be a flag determining whether the class may be
//     de-registered by context menu.
//     Add the following values for this flag (e.g. 1 + 2 = 3):
//        1     allow deregistering of this class
//        2     do not allow undoing replacement of another class with this class
//        4     do not allow creating object of this class
//     The rest of the line makes up the description which appears in the "Information"
//     window. Do not add any line breaks in this description, or it will be truncated.
//     Even though this file is mostly sorted alphabetically, this is not necessary.

WPObject 4 This is the most fundamental WPS class, from which all other WPS classes are derived. This class contains functionality common to all classes. Note: This class is only an abstract superclass for subclasses. There should not be any objects of this class directly, but only of the subclasses.
WPAbstract 4 This is the first of the three base WPS storage classes which are derived from WPObject. All subclasses of this class have in common that objects of them do not physically exist as files in the file system, but save their data in OS2.INI only. As a result, objects of subclasses of this class are not visible outside the WPS. Note: This class is only an abstract superclass for subclasses. There should not be any objects of this class directly, but only of the subclasses.
WPFileSystem 4 This is the second of the three base WPS storage classes which are derived from WPObject. All subclasses of this class (WPDataFile and WPFolder) have in common that they physically exist in the file system. The WPS stores additional configuration data for those objects in the Extended Attributes of the file, mostly in .CLASSINFO. Note: This class is only an abstract superclass for subclasses. There should not be any objects of this class directly, but only of the subclasses.
WPTransient 4 This is the third of three base WPS storage classes which are derived from WPObject. All subclasses of this class have in common that they do not store data at all, i.e. objects of these subclasses only exist temporarily, mostly for displaying information. Note: This class is only an abstract superclass for subclasses. There should not be any objects of this class directly, but only of the subclasses.
WPPalette 4 Common superclass for the different palettes in the "System setup" folder. There should not be any objects of this class directly.

XWPTrashObject 1 Objects of this class are used within the XWorkplace trash can (XWPTrashCan class, subclass of WPFolder) only to mirror the actual objects which have been moved into the hidden "\Trash" directories on each drive. These objects always have the same icon as the deleted object. See the XWorkplace User Guide for details.

LSDirectory 1 Undocumented LAN Server class. This is included with the networking functionality of Warp 4 and appears to implement network folders.

// Items added with V0.9.1

SOMObject 0 This is the base class of all SOM classes. In order to use SOM's features, any class must be derived from this class. WPObject (and thus all WPS classes) is derived from SOMObject too.
Contained 0 This is used to access the SOM Interface Repository (those ".IR" files that everybody encounters at some point, but nobody really knows more about). The IR was designed to be able to retrieve information about installed SOM classes at run-time. All objects in the IR are instances of classes which are derived from this interface class.
Container 0 Container class for the SOM Interface Repository. See "Contained".
SOMClass 0 This is the root class for all SOM metaclasses. Since, with SOM, all classes are objects too, they need to be an instance of a class themselves, the so-called "metaclass". Per default, SOMClass is the metaclass for any SOM class, but most classes define their own metaclasses with their own methods.
SOMClassMgr 0 An instance of this class is created by the SOM runtime automatically to manage SOM classes. This is needed for run-time class manipulation. It is this class which allows things like class replacements in the first place.
