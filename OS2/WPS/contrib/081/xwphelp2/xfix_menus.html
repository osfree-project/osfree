        xfix: Menu Commands Reference
    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.7 -->
<BODY>
This is a description of the commands in the <B>menu bar</B> of xfix
(see the bottom of this page for the &popmenu; on handle entries):

<UL><LI><B>xfix</B> menu

<BR><UL><LI><B>Re-parse buffer</B> will re-parse the handles buffer which has been
loaded at xfix startup from <CODE>OS2SYS.INI</CODE> and refresh the handles list
completely. This does not re-load the handles from <CODE>OS2SYS.INI</CODE> though,
which is only done at xfix startup. This item is only useful if xfix should contain a
bug which causes the display to be invalid. Also, this will update the indices in the
"i" column which are not automatically refreshed when handles are deleted.

<P><LI><B>Write back to OS2SYS.INI</B> writes the handles table back to the
<CODE>OS2SYS.INI</CODE> file. All changes you make to the handles list are not
stored unless you select this menu item. Note that this will probably have no
effect if the WPS is currently running because the WPS holds an internal copy
of the handles table and will probably overwrite your changes soon. This is why
the WPS should not be running while you're writing the handles back.

<P>See <LI><A HREF="xfix_delete.html">Deleting handles</A> also.

<!-- V0.9.20: rewrote this -->
<P><LI><B>Exit</B> will terminate the program.
</UL>

<!-- V1.0.4: added View menu -->
<LI><B>View</B> menu

<P><B>Object IDs</B> displays a new window with a list of all WPS objects with an object ID.
For each object, information about ID, handle, and long file name is displayed. The list can
be sorted by all fields. This is a purely informational window and no actions can
be applied to the objects.


<LI><B>Sort</B> menu

<P>This allows you to sort the handles list according to the values in the various
columns. (See <A HREF="xfix_list.html">The handles list</A> for a description of the
columns.) If you sort by index, the display shows the the exact order in which the
handle entries appeared in the <CODE>OS2SYS.INI</CODE> table (with ascending
node offsets as well). "Sort by index" is the default sort order after xfix startup.

<P><LI><B>Actions</B> menu

<P><B>Find invalid files</B> will check all handles in the table for whether they
point to valid files. Each item that is outdated will be marked invalid and given
the "File not found" status. This is not done automatically because this process can
take several minutes.

<P>See <A HREF="xfix_howto.html">How can I...</A> for a typical usage of this menu
item.

<P><LI><B>Select</B> menu

<!-- V1.0.4: made this an unordered list -->
<BR><UL><LI><B>Select all invalid</B> will select all handles which have been marked invalid
for any reason (i.e. have gray emphasis). You can then right-click on any of the
selected items and select "Delete" from the &popmenu;.

<!-- V1.0.4: added Select by name item -->
<P><LI><B>Select by name</B> displays a new dialog that allows you to select and deselect several
handles at once. You can select and deselect all handles, or specify a mask similar to
those that are used on the OS/2 command line, i.e. the <a href="glossary/gls_wildcards.html">wildcards</a>
<CODE>?</CODE> and <CODE>*</CODE> can be used to substitute one or several characters.
The mask <CODE>"*.txt"</CODE> would (de)select all handles with a name ending in <CODE>".txt"</CODE>,
for instance. The dialog stays opened until you press the <B>"Close"</B> button or the <B>Esc</B> key.
That way, selections with different masks can be applied successively.

<P>Note that the mask is matched against the <B>short name</B>. Thus, it is not possible to use this dialog
to easily select all handles of objects that reside in a certain directory.
</UL>

<LI><B>Help</B> menu

<!-- V1.0.4: changed "info" to "information" -->
<P>Displays help and the xfix product information with the current version and build date.

</UL>

In addition, there is a <B>&popmenu;</B> if you click on selected entries with mouse
button 2. This only contains the <B>Delete</B> command. This will remove the
handle from the internal buffer which was read from <CODE>OS2SYS.INI</CODE>
and also from the handles list display.

<P>See <A HREF="xfix_delete.html">Deleting handles</A> for more on this.
