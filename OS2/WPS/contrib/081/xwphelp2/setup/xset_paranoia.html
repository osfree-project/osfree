<!-- changed V0.9.0: this page used to be called "XFolder internals"
     and has pretty much been rewritten. However, be _very_ careful
     with updating the links below. The number of links must remain
     _exactly_ the same as previously, because otherwise the help
     panel IDs will no longer match the dialog items on the notebook page. -->
<!-- V0.9.16: replace XFolder with &xwp; -->
