<!-- V0.9.9: changed the following -->
This slider allows you to set the default
<!-- V1.0.0: link removed -->
priority of the &xwp; Worker thread.
<!-- end V0.9.9 -->

<P>The Worker thread is started at Desktop startup with the priority you specify
here. This setting allows you to specify either "idle" priority with
a priority delta of 0, or "idle" with a delta of +31, or "regular" priority
with a delta of 0.

<!-- V0.9.13: changed the following 2 lines -->
<P>See <A HREF="glossary/gls_scheduler.html">"Processes and threads"</A> for more information
about thread priorities.

<P>Note that this setting only specifies the <I>default</I> Worker thread priority.
If &xwp; finds out that the Worker thread does not get enough processor time,
its priority is raised automatically from time to time.
See <A HREF="setup/xset_p_prtybeep.html">"Beep on priority change"</A> for more.

<P>For most purposes, you should leave this setting to the default value,
which is "idle +31". This will allow the Worker thread to perform its
tasks in the background without a noticeable slowdown of the user interface.
However, if you frequently run processes which hog up your CPU (that is,
if your CPU load is always 100% because of, e.g., certain Windows applications running),
you might want to raise this to "regular".

<!-- V0.9.13: updated page name -->
<P>You can examine the current Worker thread priority on the "Threads" page.
