The "Module" pages appear in the properties notebooks of all executable
files to display additional information about an executable module.

<P>This page shows you the submodules imported by the module.

<P>The page only lists the submodule names which are explicitly listed as
imports in the module header for load-time linking.
These imports are resolved already at the time the module gets loaded, as
opposed to run-time linking (see below).
The module names are the names of the
<A HREF="glossary/gls_dll.html">dynamic link libraries</A> to be imported,
usually without the <CODE>.DLL</CODE> file name extension, and are expected
to be on the <CODE>LIBPATH</CODE> (see
<A HREF="glossary/gls_path_sys.html">"System paths"</A> for more information).

<P>If an executable fails to load, the information on this page can be useful
to find out what submodule might have failed.

<P>However, as a result of the above, this page does <I>not</I> show:

<UL><LI><B>Run-time imports,</B> when an application calls specific &os2; APIs to
import code dynamically after it has been completely loaded. This information
is not specified in the executable headers because it is the actual program
code that performs the import.
See the documentation for
<A HREF="cpref.inf#DosQueryProcAddr"><CODE>DosQueryProcAddr</CODE></A>
in the Toolkit documentation.<A HREF="_toolkitlink.html">*</A>

<P><LI><B>Indirect imports,</B> that is, sub-imports performed by the modules
listed on this page. Those imports depend on the execution context: for
example, the currently active <CODE>LIBPATH</CODE>, <CODE>BEGINLIBPATH</CODE>,
and <CODE>ENDLIBPATH</CODE>
<A HREF="glossary/gls_path_sys.html">system paths</A>
all determine which modules would be actually loaded.

</UL>To find out which module is really used by a given program file, you can
use the <CODE>PSTAT /L</CODE> command from an &os2; command prompt while that
specific program is running.
