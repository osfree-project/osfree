This setting determines whether &xshutdown; will display a little animation after
shutdown has completed. If you don't like it, switch it off.
<!-- V0.9.3: changed the following -->
<P>Per popular request, starting with V0.9.3,
there are now two settings for animation. One determines
whether to show the animation after the "regular" shutdown (either with or without
APM power-off). The other one determines whether to show the animation before rebooting
as well.
