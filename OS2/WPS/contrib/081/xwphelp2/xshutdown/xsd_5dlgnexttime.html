<BODY>
If the <B>"Show this dialog next time"</B> setting is unchecked, &xshutdown;
confirmations will be disabled for subsequent shut downs. Be warned, this
way you will not get any chance to interrupt shutdown after selecting
"Shutdown" from the Desktop's &popmenu;.

<P>You can re-enable the confirmation window on the "&xshutdown;" page in
the Desktop's <A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>.
