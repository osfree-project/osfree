<!-- Changes in this file:
     -- V0.81: Added /UL tag at bottom which was missing.
     -- V0.9.2: changed title; also see notes below.
-->
On the <!-- V0.9.2: removed this: "HPFS" and -->
"FAT" page of the object "&os2; Kernel" you may change the
&cfgsys; settings which influence the
<!-- V0.9.13: replaced the following -->
FAT file system.

<!-- V0.9.13: changed these 3 lines -->
<P>For introductory information about file systems, select from the following list:
<UL><LI><A HREF="glossary/gls_fs.html">File systems</A>
<LI><A HREF="glossary/gls_caches.html">File-system caches</A>

</UL>This help page will explain the different settings only and relate them to
<!-- V0.9.7: changed the following -->
the parameters of the <CODE>DISKCACHE</CODE> command in the &cfgsys; file.

<!-- V0.9.7: replaced this
If the information on this page regarding the different &cfgsys; settings is
not sufficient for you, you'll find additional explanations in the respective chapters
of the &os2; Command Reference. -->

<!-- V0.9.7: added this line -->
<P>See the <A HREF="cmdref.inf#diskcache">documentation</A> in the
<I>&os2; Command Reference</I> for details.

<P>Press <B>"Apply"</B> to have the changes you've made written to the
&cfgsys; file.
This will only change the &cfgsys; lines which correspond to the settings on this
page. The lines corresponding to the other pages in the "&os2; Kernel" object will
not be changed.
Please note that you will have to restart the computer to let the changes
take effect. A Desktop restart does <I>not</I> suffice.
<P>Press <B>"Optimize"</B> to have &xwp; propose you new settings according to
your system characteristics.
&cfgsys; will only be changed after you press "Apply" also.
<P>Press <B>"Default"</B> to have the &os2; default settings displayed on the notebook
page.
&cfgsys; will only be changed after you press "Apply" also.

<!-- V0.9.2: removed this
On the "HPFS" page you will find a setting called "HPFS installed".
If you do not have any HPFS drives, you can save several hundred KB of memory by
deactivating this setting, which will not load the driver HPFS.IFS at
system startup. If &xwp; has detected HPFS drives on your system, this setting
is deactivated to prevent accidents.

On both settings pages you'll find the following settings:


and added the following line:
-->

<P>This page allows you to set the following FAT settings:

<UL><LI><B>Cache size</B> determines how much KB of main memory will be reserved for
the cache of the respective file system.
This corresponds to the &cfgsys; parameter
<!-- V0.9.2: removed this
/CACHE:xxx in the IFS=?:\OS2\HPFS.IFS command for
HPFS drives and -->

<CITE>DISKCACHE=xxx</CITE> for FAT drives.
<!-- V0.9.20: rewrote this -->
<P>The maximum cache size for FAT volumes is 14440 KB.

<!-- V0.9.5: changed the following -->
<P>You may request that &os2; <B>automatically</B> determine
the cache size. In most cases, this will then result in about 10% of the installed
memory, but in general, using this setting is not recommended.

<!-- V0.9.5: moved the following text to a separate file -->
<!-- V0.9.13: replaced this phrase and link -->
<P>See <A HREF="glossary/gls_caches.html">"File-system caches"</A> for an introduction
to file-system caches in general.

<BR><LI>The setting <B>"Only cache files smaller than"</B> determines (in KB) the
maximum size of objects that will be saved in the caches. This
corresponds to
<!-- V0.9.2: removed this
the &cfgsys; parameter
/CRECL:xxx in the IFS=?:\OS2\HPFS.IFS command for
HPFS drives and -->
the second parameter in <CITE>DISKCACHE=xxx</CITE> for FAT
<!-- V0.9.20: replace drives with volumes -->
volumes.
This setting is supposed to prevent large files which are usually only loaded once from
clearing the whole cache.
However, the default value of 4 KB is way too low. It is recommended to
set these values for both file systems to 32 KB. (&xwp; will
automatically convert the FAT value to the sector size that is expected in &cfgsys;.)

<BR><LI>The <B>"Autocheck"</B> entry field
corresponds to the
<!-- V0.9.2: &cfgsys; parameter
/AUTOCHECK:xxx in the IFS=?:\OS2\HPFS.IFS command for
HPFS drives and the -->

<CITE>/AC:xxx</CITE> parameter in <CITE>DISKCACHE=xxx</CITE> for FAT
<!-- V0.9.20: replace drives with volumes -->
volumes.
Here you can determine for which
<!-- V0.9.20: replace drives with volumes -->
volumes &os2; will automatically perform a
<CITE>CHKDSK</CITE> at system startup.
<P>Simply enter the respective drive letters here (without the trailing "<CITE>:</CITE>").
&os2; will check each drive that you specify here at system startup if you have not
shut down your system properly. If you specify a plus sign ("<CITE>+</CITE>")
<I>before</I> a drive letter here, that drive will always be checked, which is not
really preferrable.
<P>Example: If you enter "<CITE>C+DE</CITE>", drive D: will always be checked, while
C: and E: only if needed.


<!-- V0.9.2: removed this

For HPFS drives, the auto-check is absolutely necessary because accessing "dirty"
HPFS partitions will result in system errors. You should enter all your
HPFS drives here because &os2; will print error messages at startup otherwise. This
applies especially to your boot drive, or &os2; will refuse to boot altogether if you
forgot to shut down or the system crashed.
For FAT drives, auto-check is not obligatory though.

and added the following line: -->

<P>As opposed to HPFS drives, for FAT <!-- V0.9.20: replace drives with volumes -->
volumes, auto-checking is not required.

<P>Press the <B>"Propose"</B> button to have all the <!-- V0.9.2: HPFS or -->
FAT <!-- V0.9.20: replace drives with volumes -->
volumes of your system
added to the entry field.

<BR><LI>The <B>"Lazy write"</B> setting determines whether &os2; is allowed to delay
writing data to disk.
<!-- V0.9.13: replaced the following with a link -->
See <A HREF="glossary/gls_caches.html">"File-system caches"</A> for an explanation.

<P>This setting corresponds to
<!-- V0.9.2: the parameter
/LAZY:x in the command RUN=?:\OS2\CACHE.EXE for HPFS drives
and the parameter -->
<CITE>LW</CITE> in the command <CITE>DISKCACHE</CITE> for FAT <!-- V0.9.20: replace drives with volumes -->
volumes.
By default, lazy writing is enabled.

<!-- V0.9.2: removed all the following, which is related to HPFS caching only

For HPFS drives you may influence lazy writing in a more detailed way.
The following values all belong to the line RUN=?:\OS2\CACHE.EXE,
which can optionally be written into &cfgsys; (and will always be written
if you let &xwp; modify your &cfgsys;).

The "Maximum delay" setting corresponds to the
/MAXAGE:xxx parameter and determines the maximum time that data may be
held back in the caches before
it will be queued for being written to disk.
The default value is 5.000 milliseconds; several sources recommend
to raise this to more than 7.000 milliseconds.
Since increasing this value also increases the
risk of data loss, you should only set this value much higher if you never experience
any system crashes. Note that if you shut down your system or press Ctrl+Alt+Del,
all the cache buffers are written to disk, so there's no danger here. "System crashes"
in this context mean complete system halts or power failures which will cause
a CHKDSK at the next bootup.
The "Cache idle time" and "Drive idle time" settings together
determine the write delay in relation to drive activity. These settings
correspond to the /BUFFERIDLE:xxx and /DISKIDLE:xxx
parameters. There seems to be much confusion about these settings, and the explanation
in the &os2; Command Reference really leaves you even more confused.
The best explanation I've found for this is from
IBM in the Toolkit documentation:

When no disk request has been made for the time specified with "Drive idle time",
i.e. a disk has not been accessed for that time, all cache blocks that
have not been modified for the time specified with "Cache idle time"
will we written to disk. As a result, raising
these two numbers will increase the chance that redundant disk accesses can be avoided.

Some sources recommend raising both of these values to as much as 60.000 milliseconds;
however, IBM also recommends that the "Disk idle time" value be set greater than the
"Cache idle time" value, which, in my view, makes sense, because otherwise some cache
areas might not be written at all.
The default values for these are 1000 and 500 milliseconds,
respectively.
