<BODY>
The settings in the "Advanced" group allow you to control whether
&os2; uses high memory.

<P>Note that all these settings require that you are running an
Aurora kernel (that is, OS/2 kernel version 4.5 or higher:
Warp Server for e-business, Warp 4 with at least fixpak 13
installed, or an IBM "Convenience Pack", or eComStation).
Otherwise all these settings will be disabled.

<UL><LI>The <B>"Virtual address limit"</B> specifies the highest
address that &os2; will give to applications when they request
high memory (above the 512 MB line). This corresponds to the
<CODE>VIRTUALADDRESSLIMIT</CODE> statement in &cfgsys;
and may be in the range of 512 up to 3072 MB.

<P>If this is set to 512 MB,
which is the default (and the only available state with non-Aurora
kernels), high memory usage is disabled altogether.

<P>Values in excess of 512 MB will reduce the number of processes
that can concurrently run on a system.

<P>See <A HREF="glossary/gls_mem_himem.html">&os2; Virtual Address Space</A> for more
information on this topic.

<P><LI>If "Disable DLL basing" is enabled, &os2; will ignore each
<!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_dll.html">DLL's</A>
base address (preferred load address) when the DLL is loaded. This
corresponds to the <CODE>DLLBASING=OFF</CODE> statement in
&cfgsys;.

<P>Enabling this setting may prevent fragmentation of the
shared arena and thus reduce the likelihood of running out of
shared memory, but performance for loading DLLs may suffer.

<P><LI>If <B>High memory for Java</B> is enabled, the &os2; Java
Virtual Machine is instructed to attempt to place its heap into
&os2;'s high memory (above the 512 MB line). This will
only work if you have set the virtual address limit above to
something greater than 512 MB.

<P>This corresponds to the <CODE>SET JAVA_HIGH_MEMORY=1</CODE>
statement in &cfgsys;.

<P>As with all high memory, this will prevent 16-bit code from
accessing that memory. Most notably, this requires that you have
TCP/IP 4.1 or higher installed.
