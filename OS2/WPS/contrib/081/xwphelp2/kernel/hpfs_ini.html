        &os2; Kernel: HPFS386.INI
    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.5 -->
<BODY>
Except for the "autocheck" parameter, HPFS386 is not configured on the &cfgsys;
command line. Instead, HPFS386 uses a separate text file called <CODE>HPFS386.INI</CODE>,
which usually resides
in the <CODE>\IBM386FS</CODE> directory on your boot drive. The location of that
file is specified on the &cfgsys; line instead.

<P><CODE>HPFS386.INI</CODE> contains too many parameters to be displayed here.
Instead, the
configuration dialog inserts a Desktop object for the <CODE>HPFS386.INI</CODE> file
into the dialog, which works just like any other Desktop object. That is, you can
right-click on the icon and use the "Open" menu to have it opened with some application,
or you can drag the icon to your favorite editor. Once you save the changes in your
editor, the settings will take effect at the next reboot.

<P><CODE>HPFS386.INI</CODE> contains a lot of comments which explain the various settings.
