<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.4 -->
<BODY>
This dialog is used for configuring <CODE>CDFS.IFS</CODE>.
 
<!-- V0.9.13
which is the Installable
File System (IFS) provided by IBM to read data from CD-ROMs.
CD-ROMs use their own special format to organize data on disk which is unlike FAT or
HPFS, so another file system driver is needed.

<P>For introductory information about file systems, select from the following list:
<UL><LI><A HREF="glossary/gls_fs.html">File systems</A>
<LI><A HREF="glossary/gls_caches.html">File-system caches</A>
 
</UL>Press <B>"Optimize"</B> to have &xwp; propose you new, optimized settings.
<P>Press <B>"Default"</B> to have the &os2; default settings displayed on the notebook
page.
 
<P>By pressing <B>"OK"</B>, the selections you made will be translated into the
"Parameters" field on the "Drivers" page in the
<!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="objects/obj_krnl.html">"&os2; Kernel"</A>
properties notebook.
This does not change your &cfgsys; yet. To do that, press "Apply" on the "Drivers"
page after pressing "OK" in this dialog.
 
<P>It is strongly recommended to enable <B>Joliet</B> support. This is Microsoft's
extension of the ISO standard CD-ROM file system to support long file names (up to
64 characters) on CD-ROMs also. Many newer CD-ROMs are unreadable on &os2; if this
setting is not enabled.
 
<P><B>Kanji</B> adds additional support for the Japanese language.
 
<P>The <B>"cache size"</B> slider sets the size of the CD-ROM file system cache. The
default of 128 KB is not a whole lot, so it is recommended to set this to 512 KB
or higher. Since the read head of a CD-ROM drive is a lot slower than those of
a hard disk, a larger cache can really speed up CD-ROM reading.
 
<P>For the same reason, you should set the <B>"File sectors to read at a time"</B>
to the maximum value. This setting determines how many sectors are read in when
a single sector is requested from the file-system driver. Since it is likely that
not only one sector, but the following sectors will also be read when a CD-ROM is
accessed, the following sectors will already be in the cache, which reduces physical
access to the CD-ROM also.
 
<!-- the following added with V0.9.5 -->
Finally, the settings in the <B>"Initialization"</B> group determine what the
IFS driver displays at startup. Per <B>default,</B> it will give a short message
that it has been loaded. <B>"Quiet"</B> will force it to display nothing, while
<B>"Verbose"</B> will have it display the current IFS settings, as specified
above.
