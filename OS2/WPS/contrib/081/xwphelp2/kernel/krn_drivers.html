<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.3 -->
<BODY>
The "Drivers" page is added by &xwp; to allow you to view the drivers
which are currently installed through the &cfgsys; file. This gives you
a handy interface to view and modify installed drivers and their parameters.

<P>The drivers are sorted into <B>categories.</B> Expand an item in the
tree on the left to view the drivers. When you <B>select</B> a driver
in the tree on the left, you will see more information on the right
for that driver.

<UL><LI>The <B>"Version"</B> and <B>"Vendor"</B> information
is retrieved directly from the driver file, similar to what the BLDLEVEL
utility does on the command line.

<P><LI>The <B>"Parameters"</B> field lists the parameters which are set
for this driver in the &cfgsys; file.

<!-- update the following for the new ConfigTool and global
     search support with V1.0.4 (2005-06-16) [chennecke] -->
</UL>The driver items in the tree on the left each have a <B>&popmenu;</B>
where you can receive additional help on that driver:

<UL><LI>If the driver is one
of the default &os2; drivers, you can probably view the corresponding page
in the <I>&os2; Command Reference</I> (<CODE>CMDREF.INF</CODE>) by selecting
<B>"Show help in &os2; Command Reference"</B>.

<P><LI>The <I>ConfigTool database</I>, a separately available freeware package,
also provides information for many drivers. Select <B>"Show help in ConfigTool database"</B>
to open the corresponding help panel for a driver. The menu item is only
enabled if the
ConfigTool INF file <CODE>CFGDAT.INF</CODE> resides in the
<a href="glossary/gls_path_sys.html">system path</a>
that is specified by the <CODE>BOOKSHELF</CODE>
<a href="glossary/gls_env.html">environment variable</a>
in &cfgsys;.

<P><LI>Some drivers come with their own help file. Often, information is also
available in help files that are not directly related to a specific driver.
Selecting <B>"Search in all help files"</B> starts a search for the driver
name in all help files that reside in the <CODE>BOOKSHELF</CODE> and
<CODE>HELP</CODE> paths. After the search has been finished, you can
browse and select the results. The menu item is only enabled if the separately available
help viewer <I>NewView</I> is installed as either a complete replacement
for <CODE>VIEW.EXE</CODE> or a stand-alone tool with executable and DLL in
<CODE>PATH</CODE> and <CODE>LIBPATH</CODE>, respectively.

</UL><!-- end V1.0.4 -->For most drivers, except for those
which won't accept parameters, you can <B>change the parameters</B> in
the parameters field.

<P>For several drivers, easy-to-use configuration dialogs have been added as well.
If the <B>"Configure"</B> button is enabled,
you can press it to have a configuration dialog for the
parameters of the currently selected drivers. Such a configuration dialog
will then change the "Parameters" entry field for you.

<P>You have to press <B>"Apply"</B> to update the &cfgsys; line with the
new parameters -- either if you have changed the "Parameters" field yourself
or if you have used a configuration dialog. Pressing "Apply" will only modify
the one line in &cfgsys; with the currently selected driver. If you select
another driver, your configuration gets lost.
