<BODY>
This dialog is used for configuration of two IDE disk drivers:

<OL><LI><CODE>IBM1S506.ADD</CODE> is the IBM driver which is shipped with &os2;.
IBM has updated this driver quite a number of times. A newer driver is required
for OS/2 Warp 3 and 4 if you wish to use hard disks which are larger than 8 MB.

<P>With this driver, many of the dialog items are disabled because they are
only used with <CODE>DANIS506.ADD</CODE> (below).

<P><LI><CODE>DANIS506.ADD</CODE> is a replacement driver written by Daniela Engert.
It is 99% command-line compatible with the IBM driver, but has added lots of
enhancements. Since the IBM drivers cannot enable busmastering
support with many of the newer chipsets, it is strongly recommended to use this
enhanced driver, which can greatly enhance hard disk performance. Also, this driver
allows to to configure your hard disk controllers in much more detail to resolve
problems with your system setups.

</OL>Detailed help for each of the settings is available in the form of
<B>fly-over help (tooltips)</B>. Put your mouse pointer over a dialog item and
wait for about a second, and an informational text will come up.

<P>It is however necessary to understand in general that both drivers differentiate
between <B>three type of options:</B>

<OL><LI><B>Global options</B> affect operation in general. Those are on the top
left of the dialog and include settings like startup messages and (with
<CODE>DANIS506.ADD</CODE>) how hardware is searched at bootup.

<P><LI><B>Adapter settings</B> affect one adapter (controller) only. With the IDE
and EIDE bus system, there is one adapter for two hard disk units. Computers
usually have two adapters built in, so this makes a total of four units which can
be connected to a standard computer. In the dialog, adapter options are on the
bottom left.

<P>With both the <CODE>IBM1S506.ADD</CODE> and the <CODE>DANIS506.ADD</CODE> drivers,
adapter settings must be specified only after an <CODE>/A:x</CODE> option, with
<CODE>x</CODE> specifying the adapter to be configured by all the following
options (either 0 or 1). The dialog will add this option automatically if you
change any adapter parameter from a non-default value. All the settings in the
<B>"Adapter (controller) settings"</B> group therefore affect only the adapter
which is currently selected in the <B>"Current adapter"</B> group.

<P>Each adapter needs a few system resources such as an interrupt (IRQ), a
Direct Memory Access (DMA) channel,
and port addresses (base address) for data interchange between the adapter and
the computer. If these options are not set, the driver uses defaults which work
on most systems.

<P>See the remarks below for details about bus-mastering (DMA) support.

<P><LI><B>Unit settings</B> affect one unit (hard disk) only. Each adapter can
have two units, which are commonly dubbed as "Master" and "Slave". In the dialog,
unit options are in the right half.

<P>With both the <CODE>IBM1S506.ADD</CODE> and the <CODE>DANIS506.ADD</CODE> drivers,
unit settings must be specified only after an <CODE>/A:x</CODE> option first
(which specifies the adapter) and a <CODE>/U:x</CODE> option next (which specifies
the unit in the adapter), with <CODE>x</CODE> being 0 or 1 each time.
The dialog will add these options automatically if you
change any unit parameter from a non-default value. All the settings in the
<B>"Unit (drive) settings"</B> group therefore affect only the unit
which is currently selected in the <B>"Current unit"</B> group.

</OL><B>Busmastering, Direct Memory Access (DMA).</B> Modern hardware allows the
EIDE controllers to read and write data directly from main memory without any
help from the main processor. This greatly enhances disk performance because while
data is exchanged with the disk, the processor can do something else.

<P>While the older Programmed I/O (PIO) modes 3 and 4 still required control by the
main processor, the EIDE standard introduced several multi-word DMA modes. In those
modes, the drive takes over control of the bus (bus-mastering) and places data
directly into the main memory (DMA). The standard <CODE>IBM1S506.ADD</CODE> fails
to recognize many chipsets and can thus not enable busmastering on many systems.
<CODE>DANIS506.ADD</CODE> does a much better job at this and still allows you to
fine-tune the detection process.

<P><B>Ultra-DMA</B> is yet another extension of the original DMA protocol.
Previously, data transfers took place only on the rising edge of the strobe signal.
Ultra DMA modifies the protocol to allow data to be sent on the falling edge
of the strobe signal as well, thus doubling the data transfer rate.
Also, because of the increased danger of data corruption, error detection
was added. As a result, Ultra-DMA is both faster and safer than regular DMA
or plain PIO.

<P>DMA with hard disks can cause problems on some hardware however. This can be due to
older controller hardware which cannot handle this at all, or bad cables which
cause too much noise on the bus so data is corrupted at higher speed.
Also, many older drives cannot handle DMA well or only at lower speed.
For this reason, busmastering can be disabled
totally or (with <CODE>DANIS506.ADD</CODE>) limited to a fixed data rate.

<P>The <B>adapter <CODE>/BM</CODE></B> setting enables or disables busmastering for
a whole adapter (that is, both units which are connected to that adapter). This
option has been available in all versions of <CODE>IBM1S506.ADD</CODE> and is
supported by <CODE>DANIS506.ADD</CODE> as well.

<P>The <B>unit <CODE>/BM</CODE></B> setting enables or disables busmastering for
one unit only. This option is only available in newer versions of <CODE>IBM1S506.ADD</CODE>
and is supported by <CODE>DANIS506.ADD</CODE> as well.

<P>With <CODE>DANIS506.ADD</CODE>, you can also limit the data rate for a certain
unit by explicitly specifying the protocol to use.
