<BODY>
Netscape DDE (or NetscDDE, for short) allows you to open HTML pages or URLs
<!-- V0.9.19: modified the following -->
with your favorite browser. Despite its name, NetscDDE supports the following
browsers:
<UL><LI>Netscape 2.02 and 4.61 for OS/2;
<LI>Mozilla and the IBM Web Browser (see remarks below);
<LI>the OS/2 port of Opera.
</UL>

<!-- end V0.9.19 -->
Using NetscDDE, you can instruct a currently running copy of the browser to
display a certain page instead of having to run a separate copy for the
new page.

<P>When starting NetscDDE, you must at least pass the URL to open on the
command line. This URL can be a local HTML file also.

<P>NetscDDE will then first look for whether the browser is already running.
If so, the running browser instance will be told to open the specified URL
in an existing window.
If not, NetscDDE will prompt you for whether the browser should be started.
Unless this is overridden with command line arguments, NetscDDE will then attempt
to start
<!-- V0.9.19: changed this -->
the default browser that is specified in your URL objects; if none is there, it
will attempt to start
<CODE>NETSCAPE.EXE</CODE> from your
<!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_path_sys.html"><CODE>PATH</CODE></A>.

<P>This will work with all known versions of Netscape on &os2;. To make
this work with Mozilla too, you must use the <CODE>-S</CODE> parameter
because Mozilla uses a different DDE server name.
On &os2;, Mozilla has been supporting DDE since version 0.9.3.

<P>Netscape DDE understands the following command line parameters:

<DL>
<DT><CODE>-q</CODE>
<DD>If this is specified, NetscDDE will not show its "Contacting..." etc.
windows (<B>quiet</B> mode).

<DT><CODE>-n</CODE>
<!-- V0.9.19: rewrote the following chunk -->
<DD>Specifies whether to use a <B>new browser window</B> when the browser is already
running. If this is specified, a new window will be opened.
By default, an existing browser window will load the URL.

<DT><CODE>-x</CODE> or <CODE>-X</CODE>
<DD>These options control NetscDDE's behavior if the DDE connection fails,
that is, if Netscape is not currently running.
If neither <CODE>-x</CODE> nor <CODE>-X</CODE> are specified, NetscDDE will
<B>prompt</B> you for whether a new instance should be started.
If <CODE>-x</CODE> is specified, NetscDDE will not prompt and <B>never start</B>
a new copy.
If <CODE>-X</CODE> is specified, NetscDDE will not prompt and <B>always start</B>
a new copy.

<DT><CODE>-p <I>fullpath</I></CODE>
<DD>This specifies the <B>executable</B> to be started if the DDE connection fails.
<!-- V0.9.19: rewrote the following chunk -->
If this is not specified, NetscDDE will look for your default browser settings
from a WPUrl object. If none are there, <CODE>NETSCAPE.EXE</CODE> on your
<!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_path_sys.html"><CODE>PATH</CODE></A>
is used.
If you want to use Mozilla, you could specify the full
<!-- V0.9.20: link added -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_path.html">path</A>
of <CODE>MOZILLA.EXE</CODE>,
for example. You could also start a batch file.

<DT><CODE>-P <I>params</I></CODE>
<DD>This specifies additional parameters for the browser to be started. The URL
given on the command line will then be added after <CODE><I>params</I></CODE>.

<DT><CODE>-s <I>directory</I></CODE>
<DD>This specifies the <B>startup directory</B> to be used if the DDE connection fails.
This is useful if the browser executable is not on the <CODE>LIBPATH</CODE> and
the browser does not find its
<!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_dll.html">DLLs</A>
otherwise.
<!-- V0.9.19: added the following chunk -->
If this is not specified, NetscDDE will look for your default browser settings
from a WPUrl object. If none are there, no startup directory is used.

<DT><CODE>-S <I>server</I></CODE>
<DD>This specifies the <B>DDE server name</B> to use. If this is not specified, NetscDDE
will use <CODE>NETSCAPE</CODE>, to which all &os2; Netscape versions will react.
However, since Mozilla uses the <CODE>Mozilla</CODE> server name, you must specify
this option explicitly to use Mozilla with NetscDDE.

<DT><CODE>-h</CODE>
<DD>If this is specified, the browser will be started <B>hidden.</B> This might
be useful if you have used the <CODE>-p</CODE> option with a batch file.

<DT><CODE>-m</CODE>
<DD>If this is specified, the browser will be started <B>minimized.</B> This might
be useful if you have used the <CODE>-p</CODE> option with a batch file.
