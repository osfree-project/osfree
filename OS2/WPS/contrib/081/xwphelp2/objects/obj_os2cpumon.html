<BODY>
The &os2; CPU Monitor displays a window with a bar or line graphic
representation of the current CPU load. If you have multiple processors
on your system, it monitors the percentage of each processor used.

<P>Note that this information is also displayed by the &xcenter;
<A HREF="xcenter/xc_pulse.html">"Pulse" widget</A>, which normally runs
when the &xcenter; is open.
