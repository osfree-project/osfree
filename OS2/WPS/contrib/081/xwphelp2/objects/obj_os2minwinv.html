<P>The <B>"&minwinv;"</B> is a special <A HREF="objects/obj_fdr_main.html">folder</A>
created by &os2; that contains all windows that are currently minimized.
This gives you one place to go for an icon view of all open objects.

<P>You find this object in the &link_sysfdr; on your Desktop.

<P>By default, when a window is minimized (either by clicking on the
"Minimize" button in the top right of a window, or by clicking on an
item in the &xcenter;'s <A HREF="xcenter/xc_winlist1.html">window list</A>),
it is removed from the display, and an icon is created in the &minwinv;
instead.

<P>You can change this behavior for the entire system on the "Window" page
in the &link_wpsobj;.
You can even specify an object's minimize behavior individually in each
object's <A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>.

<P><B>Note:</B> The &minwinv; is designed to hold only minimized windows.
You cannot place other objects into it.
