<P>On the &link_desktop;, &os2; has created the "Programs" folder
to allow you to start your application software.
It contains more &link_folders; that group &link_progobjs; by category.

<P>Initially, the "Programs" folder contains objects for the software
that was installed together with &os2;. When you later install
additional software, installation programs may choose to create
additional objects. You can also move objects into the "Programs"
folder to tidy up your Desktop.
