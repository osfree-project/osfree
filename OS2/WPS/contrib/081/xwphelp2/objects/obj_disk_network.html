<P>A <B>network drive object</B> represents a network resource that
has been assigned a drive letter.

<P><A HREF="glossary/gls_dblclk.html">Double-click</A> on the object
to open a new window that displays the &link_folders; on the volume.

<P>The <A HREF="objects/obj_os2wpnetwork.html">"Local Network" folder</A>
on the Desktop allows you to access other network resources that do
not currently have a drive letter. It also allows you to modify drive
letter assignments for network resources. As long as you have free drive
letters, you can use them to be able to access network resources more quickly.
