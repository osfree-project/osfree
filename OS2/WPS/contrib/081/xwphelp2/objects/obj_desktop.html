<P>This is the &os2; Desktop.

<P>The Desktop is opened automatically when the system starts up and covers
the entire screen. It is the heart of the <B>Workplace Shell,</B> which
is your interface to work with &os2;
and the files on your computer. It also allows you to view other computers
and share your resources if you are connected to a network.

<P>The pictures that you see on the Desktop are called <B>icons</B>.
With &os2;, they represent <B>objects</B>. All objects have certain things
in common, while other characteristics vary depending on the type of the object.

<P>Most objects that you will encounter while working with &os2;
are either &link_folders;,
<A HREF="objects/obj_dataf.html">data files</A>,
or &link_progobjs;. If you are unsure what an object does,
<A HREF="glossary/gls_select.html">select it</A>
and press the <CODE>F1</CODE> key to open a window with help about it.

<P>With &os2;, each object has associated with it a
<A HREF="glossary/gls_popmenu.html">&popmenu;</A>
that contains the options that are currently available for the object.
The Desktop itself has one too: to open it, move the mouse pointer over
empty space on the Desktop and press mouse button 2.
