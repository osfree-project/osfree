<!-- this is all new with V0.9.4 and contains text previously in

<!-- V0.9.4: added this -->
The "Object Details" container shows you lots of internal object data which you
might or might not be interested in. Much of this is mostly interesting to programmers.

<!-- V0.9.4: the following is unchanged -->
<P>This information is grouped by using a container tree view, which can be used
in a way similar to a folder tree view. However, most of the information in this
window is <I>read-only,</I> i.e. you cannot change it (except for the "Object ID" item).

<P>The <B>"Object handle"</B> is a five-digit hexadecimal number which uniquely
identifies the object on your system.
Abstract objects are always given object handles,
while file-system objects do not neccessarily have to be assigned one.

Note that
object handles cannot be used to identify objects on a different system from yours: you
cannot, for example, assume that the "Information" folder on your neighbor's computer
will have the same object handle as it does on your system.
Object handles only reference an object on <I>your</I> computer.

<!-- V1.0.0: added this link -->
<P>See <a href="glossary/gls_objhandle.html">Object Handles</a> for an introduction.

<P>The <B>"Object ID"</B> however might exist on other computers too. Object IDs always
have the format <CODE>&lt;OBJECTID&gt;</CODE> and are used to reference objects without
having to know where they actually reside.
<!-- V0.9.13: added link -->
See <A HREF="glossary/gls_objids.html">object IDs</A> for an introduction.

<P>The "Object ID" field may be <B>changed</B> by clicking on it with the "Alt" key pressed.
Be careful however when you change object IDs. Certain programs might rely on certain
IDs.

<P>The <B>"Object style"</B> tree shows you WPS-internal object flags. The
object style flags determine the WPS behavior only: for example, if the "no copy"
flag is enabled, you cannot drag-copy the file from the WPS. Note that these
flags are normally independent of
<!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_fattrs.html">file attributes</A>,
i.e. an object can have the "no delete" flag, but can still be deletable from the
command line.

<P>The <B>"Object usage"</B> tree shows you additional internal object data. This
data is mainly useful for programmers and represents the information returned by the
<!-- V1.0.0: added two links -->
<a href="wpsref.inf#wpFindUseItem"><CITE>wpFindUseItem</CITE></a>
<A HREF="_toolkitlink.html">*</A>
method.

<P>For folders, the <B>"Folder data"</B> tree contains flags which
represent the data returned by the
<!-- V1.0.0: added two links, method name was wrong -->
<a href="wpsref.inf#wpQueryFldrFlags"><CITE>wpQueryFldrFlags</CITE></a>
<A HREF="_toolkitlink.html">*</A>
method, for example whether the folder has been populated or not.
