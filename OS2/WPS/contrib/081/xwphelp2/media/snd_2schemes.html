<BODY>
The items in the <B>"Sound schemes" group</B> allow you to quickly load, save,
and delete sound schemes.
<!-- V0.9.16: added this -->
A "sound scheme" is simply a complete set of currently defined system sounds. This
allows you to store and switch all system sounds at once.

<IFNDEF __EWORKPLACE__>
<P>Sound schemes were introduced with &warp4;, but this
page will work on Warp 3 also. A sound scheme can be considered a "set" of system
sounds which can quickly be loaded all at once. Since sound schemes are (unfortunately)
stored in <CODE>OS2SYS.INI</CODE>, all users of your computer share the same sound
schemes.
</IFNDEF>

<P>The <B>"Current scheme"</B> drop-down list shows you all the sound schemes that
are currently defined on your system.
<!-- V0.9.16: added ifdef -->
<IFNDEF __EWORKPLACE__>
On Warp 4, there should be at the least four
default sound schemes, while on Warp 3 none are predefined (since Warp 3 does not
know sound schemes in the first place).
</IFNDEF>
Selecting a sound scheme will overwrite
the current sound data (after you have confirmed this).
If you see "none" in the drop-down box,
no sound scheme is currently selected, or the sound settings of a previously loaded
scheme have been altered.

<P>The <B>"Save as"</B> button allows you to save all the current sound settings
(in the "Define system sounds" group) in a new sound scheme or to overwrite an
existing one.

<P>The <B>"Delete"</B> button is only enabled if the sound schemes drop-down list
displays a sound scheme other than "none". Pressing that button will then delete
the currently selected sound scheme.
