<BODY>
In order to be able to change an object's settings from "outside" the
Workplace Shell, the WPS supports the concept of object setup strings.

<P>A WPS setup string is a sequence of <CODE>keyword=value</CODE> pairs,
each separated with a semicolon. The keywords that are understood by
an object depend on its <A HREF="glossary/gls_wpsclasses.html">class</A>.

<!-- V0.9.16: added this -->
<P>For example, to change a folder's closed and open icons, you could
use the following string:

<P><CODE>ICONFILE=C:\closed.ico;ICONNFILE=1,C:\open.ico;</CODE>

<!-- end V0.9.16 -->

<P>Since the WPS classes are organized in a hierarchical tree and inherit
from each other, an object will not only understand the setup strings
of its own class, but also those of all its parent classes. For example,
a folder will not only understand <CODE>WPFolder</CODE> keywords, but
also the generic <CODE>WPObject</CODE> keywords (which are understood
by all objects).

<P>There are many, many different object strings for the various WPS
classes.

<!-- V0.9.16 Some of them are listed in the <I>&xwp; User Guide</I>. -->

<!-- V0.9.16: added these links, and moved the files from inf.001 to xwphelp -->
Select from the following list to learn about some of them:

<!-- V0.9.20: changed all links -->
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="objects/string_1wpobject.html">WPObject</A> (all objects)
<LI><A HREF="objects/string_2wpfolder.html">WPFolder</A> (all folders)
<LI><A HREF="objects/string_4xfdesktop.html">WPDesktop</A> (the Desktop)
<LI><A HREF="objects/string_6xwptrashcan.html">XWPTrashCan</A> (the trash can)
<LI><A HREF="objects/string_5wpprogram.html">WPProgram</A> (all program objects)
<LI><A HREF="objects/string_7xcenter.html">XCenter</A> (the &xcenter;)
<LI><A HREF="objects/string_8xwpstring.html">XWPString</A> (setup string objects)
</UL>
<!-- end V0.9.20 -->

<!-- V0.9.16: replaced the following -->

There are several ways that setup strings can be invoked upon an object:

<!-- V0.9.19: replaced entity here -->
<UL><LI>&xwp; allows you to use
<A HREF="objects/obj_string.html">setup string objects</A>.

<P><LI>From
<!-- V0.9.20: added links -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_cmd_rexx.html">REXX</A>,
you can use the
<A HREF="rexx.inf#SysSetObjectData"><CODE>SysSetObjectData</CODE></A>
function or, if you are creating a new object, the
<A HREF="rexx.inf#SysCreateObject"><CODE>SysCreateObject</CODE></A> function.

<!-- V0.9.20: added links -->
<P><LI>From C code, you can use the PM
<A HREF="pmref.inf#WinSetObjectData"><CODE>WinSetObjectData</CODE></A> and
<A HREF="pmref.inf#WinCreateObject"><CODE>WinCreateObject</CODE></A>
APIs.<A HREF="_toolkitlink.html">*</A>

<!-- V0.9.20: added links -->
<P><LI>From within a WPS class, you can use the
<A HREF="wpsref.inf#wpSetup"><CODE>WPObject::wpSetup</CODE></A>
method,<A HREF="_toolkitlink.html">*</A>
which is overridden by many subclasses and implements the actual setup string
parsing within the WPS.

</UL>

<!-- end V0.9.16 -->

<B>Note:</B> As opposed to a popular misconception, when a setup string is invoked on
an object, the string itself is <I>not</I> stored anywhere. Instead, the string is
parsed by the object's WPS class, translated into the object's binary data, and
then discarded.

<P>As a result, in order to be able to retrieve setup strings again for the
display on the
<!-- V0.9.16: change "Object" to "Icon" -->
"Icon"
page in an object's properties notebook,
&xwp; has to evaluate an object's binary data and take a best guess
at what the setup string would be that would create that binary setting.
Some of the object data is completely undocumented, and unless there is
a documented way to find out what the binary object data means, &xwp;
will not be able to create a setup string from it.
