<BODY>
<B>Extended attributes (EAs)</B> are a special &os2; feature
and allow for storing additional information with a file-system
object (file or folder) on disk. The information is not part
of the object's data, but is stored together with the object in
the <A HREF="glossary/gls_fs.html">file system</A>.

<P>As opposed to the legacy
<A HREF="glossary/gls_fattrs.html">file attribute bits</A>,
<I>extended</I> attributes are a list of keywords with values, either
in text or binary format.

<P>Applications can define their own keywords for their own
use. Some keywords, however, are defined by the system and used,
for example, by the Workplace Shell. Those are called
<B>"standard extended attributes"</B>, and their keywords start
with a leading dot. See
<A HREF="glossary/gls_eas_std.html">"Standard Extended Attributes"</A>
for more information.

<IFNDEF __NOFILEPAGE2__>
<P>To <B>view</B> the extended attributes that are currently set for
a file-system object, open its
<A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>
and switch to the second "File" page.
</IFNDEF>

<P>Remarks:

<OL><LI>The total size of the EAs of a file-system object is limited
to 64 KB per object.

<P><LI>The <A HREF="glossary/gls_fs.html">file systems</A> that ship with
&os2; (HPFS, JFS, and FAT) all support extended attributes, but this may
not be the case with third-party file systems or network drives on a remote
server. EAs may be lost if you copy files between file systems that do not
support them.

<P><LI>If you use a volume under both &os2; and another operating system
that does not recognize extended attributes, the other operating system
might destroy &os2;'s EAs if you modify files. This is most likely with the
FAT file system, which is understood by almost every operating system.

<P><LI>To learn about the total space that is consumed for EAs on a drive, select
"Check disk" from a drive's <A HREF="glossary/gls_popmenu.html">popup menu</A>.
