A Local Area Network (LAN) is a computer network where the computers
are situated closely together, typically in the same building.
These networks are called <I>local</I> area networks to tell them
apart from global networks like the &link_internet;, where computers
can reside anywhere world-wide.

<P>LANs allow several computers to shared data as well as expensive
devices such as printers. They normally use special hardware,
<B>Network Interface Cards (NICs),</B> for high-speed connections
via special network cables.

<P>Use the &link_wpnetgrp; to view all
<A HREF="glossary/gls_server.html">servers</A>
that are currently sharing resources on the LAN that you are connected to.

<P>In general, there are two types of computer environment where
LAN technology is used.

<UL><LI>Traditionally, LANs have been architected hierararchically
according to the <B>"client/server"</B> philosophy, where one or
more very powerful computers, the <A HREF="glossary/gls_server.html">servers</A>,
centralize all network resources and exports them to the clients on the network.

<P><IMG SRC="img/net_clientserver.gif">

<P>For example, if your computer is part of a company network, you
will probably be using LAN technology to access resources a central server.

<P><LI>However, since networking technology has become very affordable,
LAN technology has also been used more and more in small environments.
Such networks are typically called <B>peer networks</B> because
every computer can act as a server or client or both.

<P>You can, for example, build a small LAN simply by connecting your laptop
to your desktop machine.
See <A HREF="tasks/tsk_createpeer.html">"Setting up a peer network"</A> for
an introduction.
