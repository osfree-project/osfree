The <B>Network Basic Input/Output System (NetBIOS)</B> is the
<A HREF="glossary/gls_protocols.html">networking protocol</A>
used by most <A HREF="glossary/gls_lan.html">Local Area Networks (LANs)</A>
today.

<P>It was created by IBM for its early PC Network, was adopted by
Microsoft, and has since become a de facto industry standard
since it is supported by most operating systems, including
&os2; and Microsoft Windows. Linux supports NetBIOS too with the
additional Samba software.

<P>There are several major differences between &link_tcpip;
and NetBIOS, both from a system implementation view and the
way the user works with these protocols. This is because the two
protocols serve different purposes: TCP/IP can handle a global network
like the &link_internet;, while NetBIOS is the best performance
choice for communication within a single LAN. That is why, in most
computers, both protocols are installed.

<UL><LI>NetBIOS does not assign static numbered addresses to computers
in the network. Instead, every server in the network carries a name
and exports the resources it shares by name as well. As a result,
resources on the network are typically referenced by both server
and resource name.

<P><LI>NetBIOS itself does not provide a transport mechanism.
Typically, NetBIOS uses NetBEUI as its transport mechanism, which
is automatically installed if you install the &os2; support for
NetBIOS. However, you can also choose to install
"NetBIOS over TCP/IP" to use TCP/IP as the transport mechanism.

<P><LI>The operating system itself supports accessing networking
resources, automatically mapping standard file specifications to
remote computers. For example, you can assign a drive letter to
a NetBIOS name and access the resource by drive letter and file
name as if it was on your own system.

</UL>&os2; ships with the
&link_peer;
that, if installed, supports sharing resources with other computers
on your LAN and accessing other resources conveniently.
