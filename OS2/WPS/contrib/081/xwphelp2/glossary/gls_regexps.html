<BODY>
Regular Expressions (REs) are commonly used used to determine
if a character string of interest is matched somewhere in
a set of character strings. They allow for specifying complex
matching criteria and are thus much more flexible than regular
search strings.

<P>&xwp; uses a combination of many standards for RE syntaxes.
The level of functionality is most closely modelled on extended
regular expressions (EREs) as supported by the UNIX
<CODE>egrep</CODE> and <CODE>awk</CODE> programs.
Some enhancements introduced by POSIX, those typically found in UNIX
<CODE>ex</CODE> and <CODE>vi</CODE>, and most found in GNU software
are supported too.

<P>The following rules apply (see
<A HREF="glossary/gls_regexps_bnf.html">BNF definition</A> for a formal definition):

<P><B>Basic characters</B>

<UL>
<LI>Most characters in an ERE can specified just by typing them.
For example, <CODE>abc</CODE> matches <CODE>a</CODE>, then <CODE>b</CODE>,
then <CODE>c</CODE>.

<P><LI>Certain characters have special meanings, and will have to be escaped
by preceding them with a backslash.
This applies to the following characters:

<PRE>
    ~ . ^ $ ( ) { } [ ] ? + * |
</PRE>
For example, <CODE>1\*2</CODE> matches <CODE>1</CODE>, then <CODE>*</CODE>,
then <CODE>2</CODE>.

<P><LI>To match the backslash itself, it must be escaped too. For example,
<CODE>c:\\config\.sys</CODE> matches <CODE>c:\config.sys</CODE>.

<P><LI>The backslash can be used to describe characters which are difficult to
type:

<PRE>
  \n    newline           ASCII 10
  \t    tab               ASCII  9
  \r    carriage return   ASCII 13
  \b    backspace         ASCII  8
  \f    formfeed
  \e    escape            ASCII 27
  \x07  bel               ASCII  7
</PRE>

C and C++ programmers will find this notation familiar.
Strictly speaking, according to POSIX, if <CODE>\x2e</CODE> was put in an ERE
it should mean "any character" (ASCII character 0x2e is the dot, which means
any character, see later), but this implementation treats it as
"match a full stop".

<P><LI>Sometimes the backslash is used to introduce a special ERE feature.
For example <CODE>\&lt;</CODE> means 'start of word' (see later).
The character after the backslash is generally chosen to something that
you would not need to escape, so this syntax should not cause any
problems.

</UL><B>Character sets</B>

<P>Character sets are specified in angle brackets and
define a set of acceptable characters, or possibly a set of unacceptable
characters.

<PRE>
  [abc]   matches any one character which can be a, b, or c
  [^abc]  matches any one character which is neither a, b, nor c
  [a-z]   is the set of characters in the range 'a' to 'z'
  [a-j-t] is the set of characters in the range 'a' to 't'
</PRE>

To match a <CODE>-</CODE>, <CODE>^</CODE>, <CODE>]</CODE> character
in a bracket element, escape it with a backslash. For example,
  <CODE>[\])}]</CODE> matches <CODE>]</CODE>, or <CODE>)</CODE>, or <CODE>}</CODE>.

You can also specify a complete POSIX character classes in an <I>additional</I>
brackets pair with colons. In that context,

<PRE>
  [:alnum:]   means all alphanumeric characters
              (with ASCII, same as A-Za-z0-9)
  [:lower:]   means all lowercase characters
  ... etc.
</PRE>

For example, specifying <CODE>[[:alnum:] \t]</CODE> would
allow all alphanumeric characters plus space plus tab.

<P><B>Any character</B>

<P>The dot (<CODE>.</CODE>) character matches any single character, without
caring what it actually is. For example, <CODE>t.e</CODE> matches
<CODE>the</CODE>, but not <CODE>tree</CODE>.

<P><B>Word constituent characters</B>

<P>GNU EREs define the term "word constituent character" to
include any alphanumeric character, or the underscore <CODE>_</CODE>
character to save some typing.

<P><CODE>\w</CODE> is a shorthand for any word consitiuent character
and is equivalent to <CODE>[[:alnum:]_]</CODE> or <CODE>[A-Za-z0-9_]</CODE>.
<CODE>\W</CODE> for any non-word constituent character and is
equivalent to <CODE>[^[:alnum:]_]</CODE> or <CODE>[^A-Za-z0-9_]</CODE>.

<P>These shorthands are invalid within square bracket character sets.

<P><B>Not a character</B>

<P>A Microsoft extension to EREs is to allow you to say
"any character except this character" by preceeding it with a tilde
<CODE>~</CODE>.
This is simply shorter to type than the equivelent
square bracket character set
(<CODE>~a</CODE> is shorter to type than <CODE>[^a]</CODE>).
For example, <CODE>t~he</CODE> matches
<CODE>tie</CODE>, but not <CODE>the</CODE>.

<P><B>Anchors</B>

<P>Anchors specify conditions where an expression may occur:

<PRE>
  ^       matches if we are at the start of the string
  $       matches if we are at the end of the string
  \`      GNU alternative way of writing ^
  \'      GNU alternative way of writing $
  \&lt;      matches if we are at the start of a word (or the whole string)
  \&gt;      matches if we are at the end of a word (or the whole string)
  \B      matches if we are within a word
  \y      matches if we are at the start or end of a word (or whole string)
</PRE>

Here "word" is according to the GNU definition as given above.

<P>For example, <CODE>^xyz</CODE> matches <CODE>xyz</CODE> only if it is at
the start of the line. <CODE>\&lt;fred</CODE> matches <CODE>fred</CODE>,
<CODE>freddy</CODE>, but not <CODE>alfred</CODE>.

<P><B>Repetitions</B>

<P>By using <CODE>?</CODE>, <CODE>+</CODE>, <CODE>{M}</CODE>, or <CODE>{M,N}</CODE>
you can search for repetitions:

<PRE>
  ab?c      matches a, then zero or one occurrance of b, then c
  ab+c      matches a, then one or more occurrances of b, then c
  ab*c      matches a, then zero or more occurrances of b, then c
  ab{M}c    matches a, then M occurrances of b, then c
  ab{M,}c   matches a, then M or more occurrances of b, then c
  ab{M,N}c  matches a, then between M and N occurrances of b, then c
</PRE>

<P>In the above, M and N are numbers given in decimal, where if both are
given, M must be &lt;= N.

<P>For example, <CODE>[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*</CODE>
matches any legal C or C++ identifier. <CODE>\w{10,}</CODE> matches at least
10 word constituent characters. <CODE>\&lt;[0-9]{5}\&gt;</CODE> matches a 5
digit number.

<P><B>Alternation</B>

<P>You can search for one thing or another using the <CODE>|</CODE> symbol.
For example, <CODE>fred|bill</CODE> matches <CODE>fred</CODE> or <CODE>bill</CODE>.
<CODE>fred|bill|rob</CODE> matches any one of these 3 names.

<P><B>Nested EREs</B>

<P>Brackets may be used to group EREs into sub-EREs, so that operators
such as the repetitions or alternation operator may be applied to them.
For example, <CODE>(frog|toad)+</CODE> matches one or more occurence of
<CODE>frog</CODE> or <CODE>toad</CODE>.

<P>Nesting may be performed several levels deep.

<P><B>Backreferences</B>

<P>Every time a nested ERE is matched, what it matched is recorded.
You can do a backreference later in the main ERE (which means that
whatever was matched before must be matched again) by specifying
the backslash with a single decimal number.
Up to 9 nested EREs may thus be backreferenced.

<P>For example, <CODE>\2</CODE> says the second nested ERE must
be matched again. As a result,
<CODE>(a|b)(c|d)\2\1</CODE> will match <CODE>acca</CODE>,
or <CODE>adda</CODE>, or <CODE>bcca</CODE>, or <CODE>bddb</CODE>.

<P>Note that the above example is <I>not</I> a shorthand for
writing <CODE>(a|b)(c|d)(c|d)(a|b)</CODE>. Backreferences do
not refer to the ERE, but to what was matched by it.

<P>Backreferences can be done within nested EREs to backreference
nested EREs. For example, <CODE>frog|((a|bc)d\1)</CODE> matches
<CODE>frog</CODE>, or <CODE>ada</CODE>, or <CODE>bcdbc</CODE>,
but not <CODE>adbc</CODE>.

<!--
<P><B>Substitutions</B>

<P>Sometimes EREs are used to find or match information, and sometimes they
are used as the 'find' part of a 'find and replace' operation.
Programs providing 'find and replace' are provided with the extent of
each match, and also the extents of the top level sub-EREs within them.
So a replacement pattern can easily refer to these, (typically by using the
backreference <CODE>\N</CODE> notation in the replacement string).

<PRE>
  eg: find                   ([0-9]+),"(~"*)"
      replace-with           set \2 = \1
      given-input            23,"Age"
      gives-output           set Age = 23
</PRE>

<P>Consider using the ERE <CODE>(.+)(.+)</CODE> against the string
<CODE>abcd</CODE>.
Clearly there will be a match of length 4 characters, as an ERE matches
the longest string it can.
What isn't clear is what <CODE>\1</CODE> and <CODE>\2</CODE> are in the
substitution, afterwards.
eg: We could have any one of :-

<P>
<PRE>
  \1 = a    \2 = bcd
  \1 = ab   \2 = cd
  \1 = abc  \2 = d
</PRE>

<P>Which you get is <I>undefined</I> in this implementation of EREs.
