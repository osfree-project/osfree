Since you will normally have only one processor, but expect several tasks to
run at the same time, &os2; switches between tasks
several dozen times a second. As a result, these programs appear to run in
parallel. This is called <B>multitasking.</B>

<P>But even if you have a multi-processor (SMP) system, there will
always be more tasks than processors on your system, so switching is
still required.

<P>A <B>thread</B> is &os2;'s unit for administrating task switches.
A program can contain several threads, but per definition,
it will have at least one. But since a program can have more than one
thread, switching can take place even between threads in the same
program. This is called <B>multithreading.</B> As opposed to many
other operating systems, &os2; fully supports this, and it even does
so in a very fancy and reliable way.

<P>The part of the &os2; kernel which switches between threads is called
the <B>"scheduler".</B>

<P>The term "thread" was chosen because within one thread
program instructions are executed sequentially, while between threads you
may never be sure which instruction of one thread will be executed before
or after an instruction of another thread. It is only &os2; which keeps
switching between threads without the thread even knowing about it (or, on
SMP systems, threads might actually run concurrently on several processors).

<P>Well-programmed
<!-- V0.9.20: removed &os2; -->
software uses several threads to ensure that the
user gets a quick response to his input and mouse actions. For example, if
you execute a command in a program which will take a long time, a
program should start a secondary thread for this task. While this new thread
is working in the background, the user interface (on the main thread of the
program) is ready again for new input.

<P>Not-so-well-programmed
<!-- V0.9.20: removed &os2; -->
software uses only one thread for both the
user interface and executing tasks. As a result, while executing a task, the
user interface is blocked.

<P>Threads can have different <B>priorities.</B>
<!-- V0.9.20: moved all the text about prties to gls_sched_prty.html and
replaced it with the link -->
See <A HREF="glossary/gls_sched_prty.html">"Thread priorities"</A> for details.

<P>On the other hand, a <B>process</B> is the &os2; term for an
application which has been loaded into memory. Each process must have at
least one thread.

<P>Each process contains common data as well as controls access to system
resources. Processes are protected against each other in that &os2; prohibits
access to memory which does not belong to the process attempting to
access it ("memory protection").

<P>By contrast, several threads within a
process may all access the process's memory, because memory is
administered on a per-process basis. The same applies to other system
resources such as open files.

<!-- V0.9.20: rewrote summary and added links -->
<P>To summarize: A <B>thread</B> is the &os2; kernel concept for managing
CPU ownership.
By contrast, a <B>process</B> is the concept for owning everything else:
files, devices, and memory.
