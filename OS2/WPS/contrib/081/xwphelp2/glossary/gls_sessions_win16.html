<P>&os2; has built-in support for programs that were written for Microsoft
Windows 3.x. This support is called <B>&winos2;</B> and is an adapted version
of Microsoft Windows 3.1 that runs on your &os2; system.
This allows you to operate Windows programs as though they were &os2;
programs. For example, you can run Windows programs on the &os2; Desktop or
in a separate full-screen session and still share information between &os2;
and Windows programs.

<P>Note that the &winos2; support is equivalent to Windows 3.1, but not to
Windows 95. &winos2; does not support 32-bit Windows applications. To run
32-bit Windows applications, you will need to install third-party add-ons.

<P>In the &link_syssetupfdr;, you will find the
<A HREF="objects/obj_setup_win16.html">"&winos2setup;"</A> object that
allows you to set global properties for the entire &winos2; subsystem.
These settings are used unless you have created a
<A HREF="objects/obj_pgmobj.html">program object</A> that points to a
&winos2; application to apply specific settings.

<P>A &winos2; program can run windowed or in a full-screen session.

<UL><LI>All <B>windowed &winos2;</B> programs share the same session by default.
In other words, even though they appear as multiple windows on the Desktop, they
run in the same <A HREF="glossary/gls_scheduler.html">process</A> internally.
All programs running in this session share the same DOS and &winos2; properties
which were set by the first program in the session.

<P>However, you can elect that a &winos2; program should use a <B>separate session</B>
by enabling the respective setting in the program object's
<A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>. This will require
more memory but will protect the program from other &winos2; programs, since
it runs in a separate process.

<P><LI>If you run a <B>&winos2; full-screen</B> session, as with any
<A HREF="glossary/gls_sessions_fs.html">full-screen session</A>, your &os2;
Desktop is no longer visible. However, in a &winos2; full-screen session, you
can switch back to the &os2; Desktop by selecting the "Desktop" icon at the
bottom of the &winos2; session.

</UL>In addition, every &winos2; session (windowed or full-screen) can run
in "standard" or "enhanced compatibility" mode.

<UL><LI><B>Standard mode</B> runs programs written for Microsoft Windows
3.0 and 3.1 standard mode.

<P><LI><B>Enhanced compatibility mode</B> runs programs that require
Microsoft Windows 3.0 and 3.1 enhanced mode.

</UL>All Windows 3.0 and 3.1 standard mode programs will run in a
&winos2; enhanced-compatibility mode session. The default setting for
these sessions is thus enhanced compatibility.
