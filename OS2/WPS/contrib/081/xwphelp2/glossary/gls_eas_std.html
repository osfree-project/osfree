&os2; predefines a number of
<A HREF="glossary/gls_eas.html">extended attributes (EAs)</A>. These
are called "standard EAs". The most frequently used standard EAs are:

<UL><LI><CODE>.CLASSINFO</CODE> is used by the Workplace Shell
to store its object-specific data with file-system objects.
This is binary data and contains things like the object's class
name and most of the settings if they were changed from the defaults
in the object's
<A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>.

<P><LI><CODE>.COMMENTS</CODE>, <CODE>.KEYWORDS</CODE>, and <CODE>.SUBJECT</CODE>
are used to store additional information about the file-system object
and correspond to the respective fields on the "File" page of the
object's properties notebook.

<P><LI><CODE>.ICON</CODE> is used if a file-system object
has been assigned a non-default icon, which will then also
be displayed by the Workplace Shell. If you change a file-system
object's icon on the "Icon" page of its properties notebook,
the icon is stored in this EA. (For folders, in addition,
<CODE>.ICON1</CODE> contains the folder's "open folder" icon.)

<P><LI><CODE>.LONGNAME</CODE> is used by the Workplace Shell to
store an object's title, if it does not conform to the naming
rules of the <A HREF="glossary/gls_fs.html">file system</A> where the
object resides. See
<A HREF="glossary/gls_realnames.html">"Real names"</A> for details.

<P><LI><CODE>.TYPE</CODE> contains the object's file type if it
has been changed from the default in its properties notebook.
