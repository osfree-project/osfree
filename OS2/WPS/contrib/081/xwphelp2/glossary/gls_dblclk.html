"Double-clicking" on an item means clicking twice with mouse button 1 while the
mouse is over that item.

<P>Double-click on an <B>object</B> to have it opened in its <B>default view.</B>
If you double-click on a <A HREF="objects/obj_fdr_main.html">folder</A>, a
<A HREF="objects/obj_fdr_views.html">folder view</A>
opens that displays the objects in it.

<P>Note that you can set the double-click speed (that is, the amount of time
that may pass between two clicks before &os2; no longer considers two clicks
as a double click) in the "Mouse" object in the
&link_syssetupfdr;.
