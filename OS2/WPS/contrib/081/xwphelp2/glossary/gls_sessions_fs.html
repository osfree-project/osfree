<P>When you run a program in a full-screen session, the program
covers the entire screen; you cannot see the windows and icons of
other programs on your &os2; desktop, even though they remain open and
keep running in the background.
To see the windows and icons that are hidden, press
<CODE>Alt+Esc</CODE>, or press <CODE>Ctrl+Esc</CODE> to display the
Window List.

<P>If you switch out of the full screen session while a program is
running, the session is displayed iconized in the
&xcenter;'s <A HREF="xcenter/xc_winlist1.html">window list</A> and
in the <A HREF="objects/obj_os2minwinv.html">&minwinv;</A>.
With that icon you will see the name of the running program.
You can switch back to the full-screen session by double-clicking
on the icon.

<P>The icon in the &minwinv; also has a &popmenu; that you can
use for closing the session or changing the session's properties.

<P><B>Note:</B> You must use full screen instead of a
window when a program

<UL><LI>needs access to the physical screen selector,
<LI>directly works with the display adapter instead of using &os2;'s display
drivers,
<LI>uses the &os2; monitor facility, or
<LI>attempts to register replacements for the Vio, Kbd, or Mou subsystems of the
operating system.
