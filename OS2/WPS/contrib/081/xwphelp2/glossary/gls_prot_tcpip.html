<B>TCP/IP</B> (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is
most well known for being used as the
<A HREF="glossary/gls_protocols.html">networking protocol</A>
of the &link_internet;.
However, it can also be used as a protocol in a private network.

<P>TCP/IP in turn consists of two layers.

<UL><LI>The <B>higher layer, TCP,</B>
breaks down any chunk of information (a message, or a file)
into <B>packets</B> that are numbered and then transmitted separately.
The TCP layer at the other end of the connection then reassembles the
packets into the complete data.

<P><LI>The <B>lower layer, IP,</B> handles the delivery of the packets
that were produced by TCP. For this to work, each computer in the
network needs to have a unique address, the
<A HREF="glossary/gls_prot_ipaddr.html">IP adress</A>.

<P>Each packet receives the IP addresses of both the sender and the target
computers before it is sent off, and every computer that receives the packet
on the way checks this address to determine which computer it should forward
the packet to next.
As a result, every packet may be processed by many computers on the globe
before it arrives at your computer. Packages from the same original data
chunk may take different paths over the network, but will be reassembled
correctly by TCP.

</UL>For each data chunk broken into packets, an individual connection
between two computers is established. There is no permanent connection
after the data has been received. This greatly reduces network traffic
and makes global communication possible in the first place.

<P>Note that when you temporarily connect to your Internet Service Provider (ISP)
to get access to the Internet, you will usually do so with the use
of an additional protocol, the <B>Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP).</B>
This encapsulates the IP packets so that they can be sent over a dial-up
phone connection to an access provider's modem.

<P><A HREF="glossary/gls_internet_serv.html">Internet services</A> such
as the World Wide Web (WWW) and e-mail are also implemented as additional
protocol layers on top of TCP/IP. Those layers however are not integrated
into the operating system's networking components, but rather provided by
the individual Internet applications such as your Web browser. These
protocols include the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) used by the WWW,
the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Telnet (Telnet), and the
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for mail.
