&os2; allows you to drag and drop fonts and colors on windows to make
them change their appearance. Many applications will properly react
to those changes and save them internally to reuse these new appearance
settings the next time the application is started.

<P>For example, most widgets in the <A HREF="xcenter/xc_main.html">&xcenter;</A>
will accept fonts and colors dropped on them.

<P>In detail, to <B>change a font</B>, do the following:

<OL><LI>Open the
<!-- V0.9.20: changed this -->
&link_lookfdr;.

<P><LI>Double-click on the <B>Font Palette</B> in that folder to open it.

<P><LI>
<!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_dragdrop.html">Drag</A>
one of the fonts in the palette and drop it onto the window
whose font you would like to change.
For example, drag the font onto the <A HREF="xcenter/xc_pulse.html">"Pulse" widget</A>
in the &xcenter;.

</OL>To <B>change a color,</B> do the following:

<OL><LI>Again, open the
<!-- V0.9.20: changed this -->
&link_lookfdr;.

<P><LI>Double-click on either the <B>Solid Color Palette</B> or the
<B>Mixed Color Palette</B> in that folder to open it.

<P><LI>
<A HREF="glossary/gls_dragdrop.html">Drag</A>
one of the colors in the palette and drop it onto the window to
change the window's <B>background color.</B> If you would like to change the

dragging.
