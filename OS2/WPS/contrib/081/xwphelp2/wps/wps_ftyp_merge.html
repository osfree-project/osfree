        &xwp;: Merge With WPS Filters
    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.0 -->
<BODY>
Since the standard WPS associates programs according to both file types
and file filters, and since &xwp; refines the association mechanism
to be based on enhanced file types only,
the additional dialog "Merge with WPS filters" allows you to import
previously defined file filter associations into your file types.

<P>This dialog is non-modal in nature, which means that you can still use
the "File types" notebook page while the dialog is open. If you select
a new file type on the notebook page, you will see that the "Merge"
dialog updates itself.

<P>The dialog only closes after you press the <B>"Close"</B> button.

<P>In order to import all or some of the associations which were defined for
a WPS filter into the &xwp; file-type associations, do the following:

<OL><LI><B>Select the file type</B> on the notebook page into which you would like
to import a filter -- for example "Bitmap".

<P><LI>In the "Merge" dialog, <B>select the filter</B> whose associations you would
like to import -- for example, <CODE>*.BMP</CODE>.

<P><LI>The "Associations to add" field in
the dialog will show you the programs which have been defined with that filter.
<B>Select the associations</B> in that field which you would like to add to the
current file type (in the above example, the "Bitmap" type). Press "Select all"
or "Deselect all" to, well, select or deselect all items in the associations field.

<P><LI>Press the <B>"Merge"</B> button to have the selected programs added to the
currently selected file type on the notebook page.

</OL>You can repeat any of the above steps as many times as necessary. Keep in mind that
&xwp; allows you to define hierarchical file types, where derived file types
inherit associations from their parents.

<P>Note that this dialog does <I>not</I> change the WPS filters. If you disable
&xwp;'s enhanced file-type associations in the

you will see that the WPS filters will work again as before.
