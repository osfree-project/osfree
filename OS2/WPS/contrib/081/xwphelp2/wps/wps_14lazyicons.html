<!-- this is all new with V0.9.20 -->
<BODY>
If <B>"Lazy-load data file icons"</B> is checked, folders will fill more quickly
when they are first opened. All
<A HREF="objects/obj_dataf.html">data files</A>, including
<A HREF="objects/obj_pgmf.html">program files</A>, will receive a temporary
default icon first. &xwp; will then determine the final icon (depending on the
file's association or executable icon) in the background. While the icons are
being loaded, you can already work with the files in the folder.

<P>This setting takes effect immediately.
