<!-- this is all new with V0.9.12 -->
<BODY>
The selections in the "Default folder view" group allow you to set the
default folder view for all folders on your system.

<P>This setting applies
only if a default view has not been explicitly set for a folder.
You can set an explicit default view for a folder on the "Menu" page
in a folder's properties notebook. In addition, special folder classes might
override the standard WPS folder behavior so that this setting won't
apply either.

<UL><LI>If <B>"Inherit from parent"</B> is selected, a folder will inherit
its default view from its parent folder.

<P>This is the standard WPS behavior. For example, if you open
<CODE>C:\folder\subfolder</CODE> and <CODE>subfolder</CODE> doesn't have
an explicit default view set, the WPS will look if <CODE>folder</CODE> has
a default view set, and so on, until the root of the drive is reached.
<!-- V0.9.19: removed this Only
if the WPS still hasn't found a default view then, the setting from the
third "Window" page in the "Workplace Shell" (or "System") object applies. -->

<P><LI>If you don't like this behavior, &xwp; allows you to set the
default view for folders globally now -- without the inheritance from
the parent folder. The inheritance will be disabled if you select one of
the <B>"icon", "tree", or "details"</B> view buttons from the group.
