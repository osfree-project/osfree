<BODY>
The "Select by name" menu item lets you select only some of the objects in a currently
open
<!-- V0.9.19: link added -->
<A HREF="objects/obj_fdr_main.html">folder</A>
view.

<!-- V0.9.19: removed this while &os2; per default only knows menu items for selecting all or none
of the objects in a folder. -->

<P>Selecting objects is then done in a new dialog window, where you may enter a file
specification and then press "Select" or "Deselect".

<!-- V0.9.19: rewrote the following -->
<P>How the entry field's contents are interpreted depends on the state of the
<B>"Regular expression" checkbox.</B>

<UL><LI>If the box is not checked, the entry field expects a file specification similar
to those on an &os2; command line, i.e. you may use the <CITE>*</CITE> and <CITE>?</CITE>
<A HREF="glossary/gls_wildcards.html">wildcards</A> to select several
files. For example, if you enter <CITE>*.txt</CITE> here, all files ending in <CODE>.txt</CODE>
will be selected after pressing <B>"Select";</B>
reversely, you may deselect only some files
by entering a specification and then pressing <B>"Deselect".</B>

<P><LI>By contrast, if "Regular expressions" is checked, the entry field is assumed to
contain an <A HREF="glossary/gls_regexps.html">extended regular expression</A>,
which is evalued when you press "Select" or "Deselect".
This might be useful for complex criteria. Note however that wildcard specifications
like <CODE>*.txt</CODE> will then provoke an error box because both the <CODE>*</CODE>
and the dot characters will be interpreted differently. As a regular expression, the
previous example would have to be specified as <CODE>.*\.txt</CODE>.

</UL>

<!-- end V0.9.19 -->
Even though we use the term "file" specification here, the match string also work on
abstract objects, such as program or shadow objects.

<P>The <B>"Select all"</B> and <B>"Deselect all"</B>
select or deselect all items in the folder, regardless of the current search string.

<P>The dialog window only closes when you press <B>"Close"</B> or the <B>"Esc"</B> key.
It does not
close after you press any of the other buttons. This allows you to select several groups
of files.
