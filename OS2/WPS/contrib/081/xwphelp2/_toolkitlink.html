<BODY>
Links from this documentation to the Toolkit documentation only
work if all of the following are true:

<OL><LI>You must have the Toolkit installed. The Toolkit provides
the necessary tools, documentation, and header and library files for
programming for the OS/2 and eComStation operating systems.
<IFDEF __EWORKPLACE__>
The Toolkit can be found on the eComStation installation CDs.
</IFDEF>
<IFNDEF __EWORKPLACE__>
The Toolkit can be found on the installation CDs of the IBM Convenience
Packs or eComStation.
</IFNDEF>

<P><LI>The Toolkit documentation environment variables must be set in
&cfgsys;. For example, <CODE>SET CPREF=CP1.INF+CP2.INF+CP3.INF</CODE>
defines that by using <CODE>view cpref</CODE>, you can open the entire
<I>Control Program Programming Guide and Reference</I> even though it
really consists of three INF books.

<P><LI>The Toolkit INF books must reside in a directory on the
<CODE>BOOKSHELF</CODE> (see <A HREF="glossary/gls_path_sys.html">System paths</A>).

</OL>These conditions should be met if you have allowed the Toolkit
installer to modify your &cfgsys; file.
