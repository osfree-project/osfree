<BODY>
An entry consists of four fields: <B>Criteria</B>, <B>Attribute</B>, <B>Operator</B>,
and <B>Value</B>.

<P><B>Criteria</B> defines whether a window matching the entry is included
(<B>"I"</B>) or excluded (<B>"E"</B>).  Included windows are sticky, and excluded
windows are not sticky.

<P><B>Attribute</B> defines on what element the entry relies.  As of this release,
the only possible attribute is the window title.

<P><B>Operator</B> defines the kind of comparison to use to determine if a window
matches the entry or not.  There are five possible operators for the "Title"
attribute:

<UL>
<LI><B>contains</B> will test for whether the title contains the given string at
any position.

<LI><B>begins with</B> will test for whether the title begins with the given string.

<LI><B>ends with</B> will test for whether the title ends with the given string.

<LI><B>equals</B> will test for whether the title is exactly equal to the given string.

<LI><B>matches</B> will test for whether the title matches the given string, which
is considered a <A HREF="glossary/gls_regexps.html">regular expression</A>.

</UL>All comparisons are case sensitive.

<P><B>Value</B> defines the value to compare to.  The
drop down list contains likely values, but the value does not have to be one of
those.

<P>A window is said to match an entry if the specified window's attribute matches
the value using the specified comparison operator.

<P>&pgr; will treat a window as being sticky (or not sticky) if its
matches an entry on the list on this page, starting from the top of the list.
The window is considered sticky if the criteria is <B>"I"</B>.  The window
is considered not sticky if the criteria is <B>"E"</B>.  If no matching entries
are found, the window is considered not sticky.

<P><B>Note:</B> The switch list frequently shows both the window title and the
switch list title, separated by a dash. If both appear, &pgr; will use
the title which appears after the dash.
