<BODY>
This &pgr; notebook page allows you to define "sticky" windows, that is,
windows which will be visible on all virtual desktops.

<P>The page consists of a single container which lists all currently defined
sticky criteria. Initially, this container is empty.

<P>See <A HREF="hook/pager_stickies2.html">"Sticky windows criteria"</A>
to learn how &pgr; uses the entries on this page.

<P>To <B>add a sticky window entry</B>, right-click on an empty area of the window
and select the menu item or press <B>"Add"</B>.
A dialog pops up which allows you to define a new sticky window.

<P>To <B>edit a sticky window entry</B>, double-click on the entry, or
select the entry and press <B>"Edit"</B>.

<P>To <B>remove a sticky window</B>, right-click on the entry and select the
menu item or select the entry and press <B>"Remove"</B>.

<P>Press <B>"Undo"</B> to restore the settings that were in use before
you opened this notebook page.

<P>Press <B>"Default"</B> to remove all sticky windows from the list.

<!-- V1.0.0: added a description for "Include sticky toggle in system menus" -->
<P>Check <B>"Include sticky toggle in system menus"</B> to add an entry in all
top level windows system menus that allows temporarily inverting the "sticky" state
of the window.  A window remains temporarily "sticky" until you select the
menu item again or the window is destroyed (i.e., if you close the
window or shutdown the system). Temporary sticky settings are thus not saved
with the "Sticky windows" list.

<P><B>Notes:</B>

<UL><LI>There is a maximum of 64 sticky window specifications.

<P><LI>Minimized windows, the Desktop and the system window list are
always sticky.

<P><LI>The &xcenter;s are sticky by default, but a corresponding entry
in the container can override that.
