<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.4 and contains text which was previously
     in 0987mouse_hook.html -->
<BODY>
If the <B>"Enable"</B> item in the "Sliding menus" section is checked, the &xwp;
hook will always automatically select the menu item under the mouse if any menu control is
currently visible. This applies to pull-down menus from menu bars as well as popup
(context) menus.

<P>If the <B>"Submenu delay"</B> second is set to zero, the menu item under the
mouse will always be selected immediately. The menu then behaves as if you moved the
mouse over the menu with mouse button 1 held down all the time.

<P>However, if the submenu delay setting is raised, &xwp; will delay the menu
item selection for the time which you specify here. This is useful to avoid lots of
unnecessary screen repaints.
<IFNDEF __EWORKPLACE__>
Also, some submenus may take quite a while to compose (such as &xwp;'s
<!-- V0.9.19: link added -->
<A HREF="menus/menu_content.html">folder content menus</A>).
</IFNDEF>

<!-- V0.9.6: added the following paragraph -->
<P>If <B>"Conditional cascade sensitivity"</B> is enabled, &xwp; will give
special treatment to submenus with the "conditional cascade" style (i.e. those submenus
with the button in them).
<!-- V0.9.9: rewrote the following -->
Such submenus will then only open if the mouse is moved over the button and ignored
otherwise. This is more like the NPS WPS behavior, if you prefer that.

<P>If the submenu delay above has been enabled, the <B>"Immediate hilite"</B> box gets
activated also. This will always high-lite the menu item under the mouse immediately
without actually selecting it. That is, the menu item under the mouse will always be
painted in hilite color, but if it's a submenu, the submenu will only open after the
"submenu delay". This is pretty close to the Windows 95 behavior.
