        &xwp;: Sliding Focus

<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.4 and contains text which was previously
     in 0987mouse_hook.html -->
<BODY>
If the <B>"Enable"</B> setting in the "Sliding focus" group is checked, the "sliding focus"
feature of the
<!-- V0.9.13: changed rest of this paragraph -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_hook.html" TARGET="_top">&xwp; PM hook</A>
becomes enabled. After this, &xwp; will always make the window which is currently
under the mouse pointer active, even if you have not clicked on it. This feature
is most prominent under X Window systems (where it is usually called "Focus follows mouse"),
but is very helpful on &os2; as well.
<!-- end V0.9.13 -->

<P>The other items in the
"Sliding focus" group can then be used to influence the behavior of this feature:

<!-- V0.9.2: moved the following paragraph here from the bottom -->
<UL><LI>With the <B>"Activation delay"</B> slider, you can tell &xwp; to delay switching the
focus for a certain amount of time (specified in milliseconds) after the mouse has
moved. This might be useful if you wish to avoid too much window flickering when
the mouse is moved over many windows. If the delay is set
to 0, focus will be switched immediately when the mouse is moved (i.e. there will be no delay).

<P><LI>If <B>"Bring windows to top"</B> is checked, &xwp; will always make the
window under the mouse pointer the topmost window, as if you had clicked inside
of it (or on its titlebar). As a result, the active window and the topmost window
will always be identical.

<P>If this setting is disabled, &xwp; will only give
the window under the mouse pointer the keyboard focus, without raising the window
itself. As a result, the active window and the topmost window need not be the same.
This allows you, for example, to type into a window in the background.

<P><LI>The <B>"Ignore seamless &winos2;"</B> setting determines the special treatment
which is required for seamless &winos2; windows (that is, those appearing on the
PM desktop together with other PM windows). See the <I>&xwp; User Guide</I>
for details about this problem.

<!-- V0.9.4: updated the following two paragraphs -->
<P>If this setting is <B>checked,</B> seamless &winos2; windows will never be given focus when the
mouse is moved over them. This effectively restores the original &os2; behavior for seamless
&winos2; windows. You thus have to click into them to have them activated.

<P>If this setting is <B>unchecked,</B> &winos2; windows will always be
brought to the foreground when the mouse is moved over them, no matter whether the
"Bring windows to top" setting is checked.

<P><LI>If <B>"Ignore Desktop"</B> is checked, the Desktop window will never be given
focus by the "sliding focus" feature. To give the Desktop the focus, you will still
have to click upon it. (Note that "Desktop" here means both the WPS Desktop window,
which is a special folder window, as well as the PM Desktop, which is invisible
as soon as the Desktop starts.)

<!-- V0.9.2: added the following paragraph -->
<!-- V0.9.19: removed it again
<P><LI>If <B>"Ignore &pgr;"</B> is checked, the &xwp; &pgr; window will
never be given the sliding focus. This item is disabled if &pgr; itself is not enabled.
