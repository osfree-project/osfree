The "Module" pages appear in the properties notebooks of all executable
files to display additional information about an executable module.

<P>This page shows you the functions that are exported by the module and can
thus be imported by other modules (either through load-time loading or explicitly
through run-time loading).

<P>For each function, the following fields are displayed:

<UL><LI>Each exported function must have an <B>ordinal number,</B> which is
unique within the module. The first possible ordinal value is 1, and the last
65535. Not all ordinal values correspond to an exported function.

<P><LI>Each exported function must also have a <B>type,</B> being one of the following:

<UL><LI><B>Entry16:</B> a 16-bit function.
<LI><B>Entry32:</B> a 32-bit function.
<LI><B>286 Call Gate:</B> a 16-bit function that causes a ring 2 switch.
<LI><B>Forwarder:</B> a forwarder, that is, calling this entry point in
turn calls another exported function (either in this module or in
an imported module).

</UL><LI>Optionally, exported functions can have <B>name.</B> This name, if
defined, is case-sensitive.

</UL>Imports can be performed either by ordinal (which always works) or by name
(which works only if a name is defined for the imported function).
