        &xcenter;: Pulse Widget

<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.7 -->
<BODY>
The
<!-- V0.9.19: added link -->
<A HREF="xcenter/xc_main.html">&xcenter;</A>
<B>"Pulse" widget</B> displays the current CPU load together with a graph of
past CPU activity. This is updated once a second.
<IFNDEF __EWORKPLACE__>
It is quite similar to the respective monitor in the &warpcenter;.
</IFNDEF>

<!-- V0.9.9: added the following -->
<P>The display will roughly look like the following:
<BR><IMG SRC="img/xc_pulse.gif">

<P>The cyan part of the graph represents the "user" load of the system, while the
blue part represents the "IRQ" load. The percentage that is printed in the center
always represents the current combined "user" and "IRQ" loads.
<!-- V0.9.19: added this -->
If you are running a multi-processor system, you will get one "user" graph for
each CPU. However, even then you will only have one "IRQ" graph because per
definition, &os2; processes all interrupts on the first CPU in the system.
See the remarks below for details about this.
<!-- end V0.9.9 -->

<!-- V0.9.19: changed the following -->
<P>Note that you can
<A HREF="glossary/gls_dropfonts.html">drag and drop fonts and colors</A>
onto the pulse widget.
Besides, it is
<!-- V0.9.19: replaced link -->
<A HREF="xcenter/xc_main_sizbar.html">sizeable</A>.

<!-- V0.9.19: removed
Presently, the pulse widget can only display the load of the first CPU, in
case you are running &os2; on a multi-processor system. -->

<P><B>Implementation Details</B>

<!-- V0.9.9: rewrote most of the following -->
<P>Internally, the pulse widget uses the <CODE>DosPerfSysCall</CODE> API
(see the documentation for
<A HREF="cpref.inf#DosPerfSysCall"><CODE>DosPerfSysCall</CODE></A>
in the Toolkit documentation<A HREF="_toolkitlink.html">*</A>).

This API has the advantage that in order to measure CPU activity, one can directly
access the performance counters in the &os2; kernel instead of having to
run a second idle-time thread which consumes all remaining CPU time itself
(and therefore additional battery power on laptops).

<P>As a result, running the pulse widget does <I>not</I> consume additional CPU time
except for the time needed to paint the widget itself. In other words, the pulse
widget does not compute CPU load itself, it only queries the &os2; kernel for the
current load and displays this in a graph.

<P>The widget's own overhead for painting is also the reason why you will probably
never see a CPU load of zero, even if you are not currently doing anything with
your system. On the author's system (a Pentium II-400), the CPU load never goes
below 0.7% with the standard widget size.

<!-- V0.9.9: added all the following -->
<P><B>Requirements</B>

<!-- V0.9.19: refreshed this -->
<IFNDEF __EWORKPLACE__>
<P>The <CODE>DosPerfSysCall</CODE> API has only been introduced fairly recently
and may not work on your system. It should work with Warp 4 and above (or Warp 3
with an equivalent fixpak level; should be fixpak 26).
</IFNDEF>

<P>The IBM documentation for <CODE>DosPerfSysCall</CODE> states that a Pentium
processor is required for the kernel performance counters to work.
<!-- end V0.9.19 -->

<P>If the widget does not display a graph but <CODE>"E xxx"</CODE> only (with
<CODE>xxx</CODE> being a standard &os2; error code), an error occurred. Most probably, you
will get <CODE>"E 182"</CODE>, which means that the <CODE>DosPerfSysCall</CODE> API wasn't
found on your system. For other error codes, you can try typing <CODE>HELP SYSxxx</CODE>
on a command line.

<P><B>"User" and "IRQ" load</B>

<P>For each performance snapshot, <CODE>DosPerfSysCall</CODE> returns values for "user"
and "IRQ" loads, respectively.

<P>The <B>"user" load</B> is the time that was spent in "task time" code. Essentially,
this means that the CPU was busy executing code in either an application or the &os2;
kernel or a device driver in the regular execution flow of processes and threads,
as controlled by the scheduler in the &os2; kernel.
<!-- V0.9.13: changed this -->
(See <A HREF="glossary/gls_scheduler.html">"Processes and threads"</A> for details.)

<P>By contrast, the <B>"IRQ" load</B> represents the time that was needed to process
interrupts. As you might know, interrupts are a way for hardware components to signal
to the CPU that some important event occurred which needs to be serviced immediately.
Most commonly, interrupts are raised by hard disks, sound cards, network adapters,
<!-- V0.9.19: added serials and printers-->
and serial and printer communications.
These devices cannot afford to wait until the &os2; scheduler has finished a process
timeslice and is ready to switch to another task. Instead, when an IRQ comes in,
the &os2; kernel interrupts the regular scheduling sequence and calls an interrupt
handler instead, which, in most cases, will be code in some device driver. (In
general, only &os2; device drivers can install interrupt handlers.) For example,
if an interrupt from the hard disk comes in, code in <CODE>IBM1S506.ADD</CODE> will
be called immediately to service the interrupt.

<P>If you never see any IRQ load on your system, this is normal. This is
probably the case if you do not have any network adapters installed and you have
busmastering enabled for your hard disks. However, if you have a high IRQ load,
you might consider taking measurements to reduce it -- enable busmastering for your
hard disks and/or get a network adapter which is capable of busmastering.
