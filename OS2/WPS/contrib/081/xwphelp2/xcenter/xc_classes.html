<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.11 -->
<BODY>
The "Classes" page in an
<!-- V0.9.19: added link -->
<A HREF="xcenter/xc_main.html">&xcenter;</A>
properties notebook allows you to view
the
<!-- V0.9.19: added link -->
<A HREF="xcenter/xc_main_widgets.html">widget</A>
classes that are currently available.
<!-- V0.9.19: removed this For an introduction about the &xcenter;
and widgets, see this page. -->

<P>Note that widget classes are not true WPS classes. Only the &xcenter; uses the
class names to organize widgets internally. Consider a widget class a template that
widgets can be created from. A widget class is either built into the &xcenter; itself
or loaded from a plug-in
<!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_dll.html">DLL</A>
from the
<IFNDEF __EWORKPLACE__>
<CODE>plugins\xcenter</CODE>
</IFNDEF>
<IFDEF __EWORKPLACE__>
<CODE>ecs\system\ewps\plugins\ecenter</CODE>
</IFDEF>
directory. Such a plug-in DLL can contain one or more widget classes.

<P>As opposed to the "Widgets" page, which lists the current widgets of a single &xcenter;,
the "Classes" page displays the same widget classes for each &xcenter;.
The classes listed here are then also listed
in the "Add widget" submenu of an open &xcenter;'s &popmenu;.

<P>The following fields are displayed:

<UL><LI>The <B>"DLL"</B> field shows the name of the
<!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_dll.html">dynamic link library (DLL)</A>
which implements
the widget. This is either one of the DLLs in the
<IFNDEF __EWORKPLACE__>
<CODE>plugins\xcenter</CODE>
</IFNDEF>
<IFDEF __EWORKPLACE__>
<CODE>ecs\system\ewps\plugins\ecenter</CODE>
</IFDEF>
directory or will show "built-in" if the widget is built into &xwp; itself.

<P><LI>The <B>"Widget class"</B> shows the internal name of the class which is used
by the &xcenter; to identify the class to which a widget belongs. This name is
critical to the widget's operation and will never change, unless the DLL is no longer
available.

<P><LI>The <B>"Class title"</B> field is the same as in the "Add widget" menu and
is a descriptive name of the class. This is only for informational purposes and not
critical to the widget's operation.

<P><LI>The <B>"Version"</B> field shows the minimum &xcenter; version that the widget
requires to work. The &xcenter; checks this version number to make sure that it can
load a plug-in DLL. This field makes no sense for built-in widgets and is therefore
empty for them.
