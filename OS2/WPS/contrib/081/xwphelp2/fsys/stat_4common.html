    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<!-- V0.9.13: This is an almost exact copy of the file with the same name
     from the 001\inf.001 directory. The status bar code descriptions
     were simply moved from the INF to the HLP file.
     Only the following things were changed:
        --  HTML tag on top;
        --  class reference below was removed.
     The following change notes specify changes to the original
     file that was in 001\inf.001. -->

<!-- This file is all new with V0.84 and contains the status bar codes
     previously described in fldr_32statusbars.html. Nothing else has changed. -->
<!-- Changed with V0.9.0: see notes below -->
<!-- V0.9.11 (2001-04-22) [umoeller]: largely rewritten. -->
<BODY>
<!-- V0.9.0: add the following line -->
<!-- V0.9.13: removed this -- Class: XFolder -->
The following codes work <B>in all three modes:</B>
<BR><DL>
<DT><CITE>  $c      </CITE><DD>number of currently selected objects
<DT><CITE>  $C      </CITE><DD>total number of objects in folder

<!-- V0.9.13: replaced the following -->
<BR><DT><CITE>  $s<I>X</I>     </CITE><DD>total size of selected objects
<DT><CITE>  $S<I>X</I>     </CITE><DD>total size of folder content
<DT><CITE>  $f<I>X</I>     </CITE><DD>free space on the folder's drive
<DT><CITE>  $z<I>X</I>     </CITE><DD>total size of the folder's drive

<!-- V0.9.13: replaced the following -->
<P>In the above four, <CODE><I>X</I></CODE> is a
special <A HREF="fsys/stat_99format.html">format specifier</A> character.
<!-- end V0.9.11/V0.9.13 rewrite -->

<BR><DT><CITE>  $x(xxx) </CITE><DD>Left-oriented tabulator:
print the following information at X position "xxx" (relative to the left border of
the status bar).
<BR>Example: <CITE>$x(300)$sK</CITE> will always print the total size of the selected
objects at X position 300.
<DT><CITE>  $x(-xxx) </CITE><DD>like before, but relative to the right border of
the status bar.
<BR>Example: <CITE>$x(-150)$sK</CITE> will print the total size of the selected objects
at X position 100, if the status bar is currently 250 pixels wide.
<DT><CITE>  $x(xx%) </CITE><DD>like before, but the X position will be calculated
using "xx" as a percentage relative to the current width of the status bar.
<BR>Example: <CITE>$x(50%)$sK</CITE> will always print the total size of the selected
objects in the center of the status bar.
