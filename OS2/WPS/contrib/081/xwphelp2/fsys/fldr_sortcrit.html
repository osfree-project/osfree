<BODY>
The following four sort criteria are <I>always</I> available in all
<!-- V0.9.19: link added -->
&link_folders;:

<UL><LI><B>Sort by name:</B> this sorts a folder alphabetically according
to the object titles.

<P><LI><B>Sort by type:</B> this sorts a folder according to object types, i.e.
the <CODE>.TYPE</CODE> Extended Attribute which can be set in an object's
properties notebook. Note that this applies only to data file objects; all other
objects (and data file objects with undefined types) will be sorted to the bottom.

<P><LI><B>Sort by class:</B> this sorts a folder according to object classes,
i.e. what is visible in the third column of a folder's Details view.

<P><LI><B>Sort by file-name extension:</B> this sorts a folder according to
the characters after the last dot in an object's title, which should normally
be a file-name extension (such as <CODE>.TXT</CODE>, <CODE>.EXE</CODE> etc.).
Objects without extensions are sorted in first.

</UL>Unless a folder has changed its sort class to something other than
WPFileSystem, which normally only happens with special folders such as
the trash can and the "Fonts" folder, the following sort criteria are also
available:

<UL><LI><B>Sort by real name:</B> this sorts a folder alphabetically according
to file-system names. Since only file-system objects have real names, abstract
objects will not be sorted properly.

<P><LI><B>Sort by size:</B> this sorts a folder according to file sizes. Since
abstract objects have no file size, but only occupy some space in OS2.INI, they
are assumed to have a size of zero bytes.

<P><LI><B>Sort by last write / last access / creation date:</B>
this sorts a folder according to this file-system information, which is also
not available for abstract objects. Note that the
<!-- V0.9.13: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_fs.html">FAT</A>
file system does not
support all this information, so these three criteria will make no difference
there.

</UL>If the <B>"Folders first"</B> setting is also enabled, all folders
are sorted to the top of the folder.

<P>Within the group of folders and non-folder objects, sorting is done according
to the current sort criterion, respectively. For example, if "sort by last write date"
is selected and "folders first" is also enabled, all subfolders
are put on top, and all subfolders are then sorted by last write
date, and all non-folder objects are also sorted by last write date.
