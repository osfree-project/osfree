        Drive Not Supported by Trash Can

<BODY>
This message appears when you have attempted to delete an object, but the
drive on which the object resides is not supported by the
<A HREF="objects/obj_trash.html">&xwp; trash can</A>.

<P>This message means that the object is on a drive with a
<A HREF="glossary/gls_fs.html">file system</A> that the trash can does not enable
support for by default. This is most frequently
the case for remote network drives and more exotic installable file system drivers
where the trash can cannot be sure whether it can write to the file system without
provoking errors.

<P>Do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Press "Yes" in the confirmation dialog to have the object permanently deleted
without moving it into the trash can first. Note that this operation can
probably not be undone; if you delete the wrong object, it will be gone anyway.

<P><LI>If you are sure that the trash can can support the file system on which
the object resides, you can enable support for the drive in the
<A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A> of the trash can.
