&xwp; allows you to modify the way folders are displayed on your system
in great detail.

In general, you can modify view settings in the following places:

<UL><LI>The
&link_wpsobj; has
many options which will affect view settings globally, i.e. for
all objects on the system.

<P><LI>By contrast, you can modify the settings for an individual
folder in its own
<A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>.

</UL>Among others, you can change the following settings:

<UL><LI>For each folder, you can select an individual <B>background bitmap</B>
on the "Background" page its properties notebook.

<P>Open the
<!-- V0.9.20: changed this -->
&link_lookfdr;
and select the "Scheme palette" to change folder
backgrounds globally for all folders on the system.

<P><LI>You can change the <B>default view</B> of each folder to either
<A HREF="objects/obj_fdr_views.html">Icon, Tree, or Details view</A>
on the "Menu" page in a
folder's properties notebook. To change this globally,
use the "Folder views" page in the
"Workplace Shell" object.

<P><LI>You can influence what <B>items are displayed</B> in each of the Icon,
Tree, or Details views on the "View" pages in each folder's properties
notebook.

<P><LI>You can disable the folder <B>menu bar</B> or the <B>status bar</B>
either in the "View" menu, or on the "Menu" and "View" pages in the folder
properties, or globally on the "Menu" and "Status bar" pages in the
"Workplace Shell" object.
Note also that you can
<A HREF="glossary/gls_dropfonts.html">drag and drop fonts and colors</A>
onto any status bar.

<P><LI>You can disable many menu items on the "Menu" pages in the
"Workplace Shell" object, if you find all the options confusing.
