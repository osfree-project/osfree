        xfix: Deleting handles
    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.7 -->
<BODY>
You can delete file handles from the handles table by selecting the
"Delete" item from the &popmenu; that comes up when you click with
mouse button 2 onto the entries in the table.

<P>For each entry that is deleted this way, all following nodes are
moved towards the front of the handles table from <CODE>OS2SYS.INI</CODE>
and their entry in the display is removed.

<P><B>Warning:</B> xfix does not prevent you from deleting handles which are
needed for the WPS to work. You should only delete a handle if you know it is not
used. Deleting handles can solidly break things (program objects, folder positions,
or even the Desktop completely). See
<A HREF="xfix_handles.html">About WPS file handles</A> for more about
how handles are used in the WPS.

<P>You should pay special attention to the "Refcs." column in the
<A HREF="xfix_list.html">handles list</A>:

<UL><LI>If abstract objects were found for a handle (marked with <CODE>ABS</CODE>),
xfix will remove them from <CODE>PM_Abstract:FldrContent</CODE> in <CODE>OS2.INI</CODE>
without further notice. In addition, for each abstract object, its definition in
<CODE>PM_Abstract:Objects</CODE> is deleted.

<P>In other words, <B>this will nuke all abstract objects in that folder.</B>

<P>This is necessary because if the abstract objects were not deleted, they
would sooner or later pop up in some other folder as soon as the WPS
reuses the deleted handle for a new folder. This is quite probable.

<P><LI>Deleting entries with associated folder positions (marked with <CODE>FPOS</CODE>)
is not dangerous though.
xfix will simply kill the corresponding entry in <CODE>PM_Workplace:FolderPos</CODE>,
which no longer serves any purpose.

</UL>Note that these two are the only references that xfix can detect at the moment.
xfix cannot find out presently whether the handle is currently the target of a
program object or shadow or whatever. In other words, if the "Refcs." field is
empty, <B>this does not mean that deleting the handle won't break things.</B>

<P>Keep in mind that selecting "Delete" does not update <CODE>OS2SYS.INI</CODE>
yet. This only happens if you select "Write back to OS2SYS.INI" from the
xfix <A HREF="xfix_menus.html">menu.</A> As a result, if you accidentally
remove the wrong entry, you have not ruined your system yet... you can then restart
xfix to try again.

<P>Before using "Write back...", make sure the following  is true:

<UL><LI>You have a working WPS backup in case something goes wrong.
<P><LI>The WPS is not currently running. You are safe if you have changed
<CODE>RUNWORKPLACE</CODE> in your &cfgsys; file or if you
have started xfix from &xwp;'s "Panic" dialog during Desktop startup.

</UL>If you delete handles this way, the following fields in the
<A HREF="xfix_list.html">handles list</A> will change:

<UL><LI>The <B>node offset</B> of all items after each deleted item will be
refreshed because they have been moved towards the front of the handles
table. For example, if you delete the handle at offset 1000 and the handle
after it had the offset 1030, that second handle will then have the offset 1000
instead.

<P><LI>All handles which used the handle to be deleted as their parent handle
(and their sub-handles in turn) will be marked "orphaned" and invalid.

<P>This can also be used to quickly delete those subitems as well, if you
use "Select all invalid" afterwards.

<P><LI>If you delete a duplicate handle, the <B>Dups</B> field should be updated
as well.
