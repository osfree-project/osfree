1. INTRODUCTION
===============

    Welcome to XWorkplace V1.1.0

    XWorkplace is a complex set of replacement classes for the
    OS/2 Workplace Shell to enhance the WPS's behavior in many
    ways.

    This README has additional information which is not included
    in the XWorkplace User Guide. Please read through all of this
    before installing.

    After installation, you can find this README in the main
    install directory.


    About this release
    ------------------

    This is the first release off the 1.1 trunk with the bugfixes
    that have piled up here since the last 1.0 branch release.

    For details, refer to the "Version Notices" in the
    "XWorkplace User Guide". To extract the documentation
    only, see "3. INSTALLATION" below.


2. REQUIREMENTS
===============

    XWorkplace is developed and tested only under eComStation
    1.x, which is equivalent -- as far as the OS/2 code base
    is concerned -- to the Merlin Convenience Package 1 (MCP1).

    NOTE: As opposed to previous releases, XWorkplace 1.0.0
    and higher will NO LONGER work on OS/2 Warp 3. SO DO NOT
    TRY TO INSTALL THIS ON WARP 3. There have also been reports
    that XWorkplace has problems on Warp 4 if the latest fixpacks
    are not installed, but I have not confirmed this.

    The following OS/2 versions should be safe, since they are
    based on roughly the same IBM code:

    --  Warp 4 FP 15

    --  WarpServer for e-Business

    --  Merlin/Aurora Convenience Packages

    --  eComStation 1.x

    XWorkplace 1.1.0 and higher provide access to additional information
    about drivers. The following requirements apply:
   
    -- The CFGDAT.INF file from the ConfigTool freeware package must
       reside in a directory on the path that is specified by the
       BOOKSHELF environment variable in CONFIG.SYS.

    -- The enhanced help viewer NewView must be installed as either
       a complete replacement of VIEW.EXE or as a stand-alone tool
       with the executable residing in PATH and the DLL residing
       in LIBPATH.


3. INSTALLATION
===============

    XWorkplace must be installed using WarpIN. After all files
    have been copied, WarpIN will restart your Workplace Shell
    to make sure the changes become active. A reboot should not
    be necessary.

    If you are still unsure whether you should use XWorkplace at
    this point, you can select the "Documentation" package in this
    archive only. This way can then read through XWorkplace's
    documentation first and decide then whether to actually install
    all of it. To install later, simply double-click on XWorkplace's
    .WPI archive again.

    Some WARNINGS:

    --  In any case, before installing, MAKE A WPS BACKUP.

    --  It was reported that the Workplace Shell hangs itself
        up after the restart if you have the "Automatic lockup
        on startup" setting enabled. In that case, disable that
        setting before allowing WarpIN to restart the WPS.


    Installing on eComStation 1.x
    -----------------------------

    If you are installing on eComStation 1.x, note that
    the "Desktop enhancements" of that version include a
    special version of XWorkplace that will conflict with
    the standalone version. Do one of the following:

    *   Install this release of XWorkplace over the version
        that comes with eCS 1.x -- that is, when WarpIN
        asks you about the target directory, enter
        ?:\ecs\system\ewps (on your boot drive).

        Note however that this will overwrite the version
        that comes with eCS, which cannot easily be recovered.

    *   Alternatively, exit this XWorkplace installation now
        and deinstall the eCS version first by running

            ?:\ecs\system\ewps\install\deinst.cmd

        Restart your desktop (or reboot), and then install
        XWorkplace to any directory.


4. UPGRADING
============

    Upgrading from XWorkplace
    -------------------------

    IMPORTANT: If you are installing while the WPS is running
    (which is most probably the case), WarpIN will show you
    confirmation dialogs about various files that are currently
    in use, most importantly, XFLDR.DLL. This is normal because
    those modules are loaded while the WPS (and thus XWorkplace)
    is running.

    In those dialogs, you MUST select "Unlock (DosReplaceModule)",
    or your installation will not be fully updated.

    If you get this message for a help file (.HLP extension), the
    XWorkplace help file is currently held open by the WPS.
    Unfortunately, with OS/2, it is impossible to unlock data files
    automatically. To unlock the help file, while the "locked"
    dialog is showing, simply open any standard WPS help panel
    (e.g. by clicking on an empty space on the desktop and
    pressing F1), which will unlock XWorkplace's help file.

    Besides, you will probably get a notification message that
    XWPDAEMN.EXE is running and must be killed. Have WarpIN kill
    that program (which is the XWorkplace Daemon).
    This has the unfortunate side-effect of making all your
    XWorkplace Startup Folders start if you accept WarpIN's offer
    to restart the desktop at the end of installation, even if
    they are set to start on reboots only.
    If this is a problem, then you should decline the offer to
    restart the Desktop, and you should reboot manually after
    installation has completed.

    If upgrading doesn't work, have WarpIN remove the installed
    XWorkplace version first, restart the WPS, and install the
    new version then.


    Upgrading from XFolder
    ----------------------

    XWorkplace is the successor to XFolder V0.85.

    XWorkplace and XFolder cannot coexist, since XWorkplace
    provides all the features of XFolder 0.85 plus many bugfixes
    and even more features.

    As a result, if XFolder is installed, XWorkplace will
    disable your XFolder installation.

    Still, you should install XWorkplace to a directory OTHER
    than your existing XFolder directory to make sure no file
    conflicts occur. Several people have reported that
    installing to the same directory can hang your WPS.

    XWorkplace can take over your existing XFolder 0.85 settings,
    if present. You will be prompted for that during the first
    WPS restart after installation. However, many new settings
    have arrived, so many will be initially disabled.

    If you prefer to go back to your existing XFolder installation
    later (after all, this is a developer's release), have WarpIN
    de-install XWorkplace and install XFolder again, using
    INSTALL.CMD in your XFolder directory. Your old XFolder
    settings remain untouched by XWorkplace.


5. NATIONAL LANGUAGE SUPPORT
============================

    This archive contains XWorkplace National Language Support
    (NLS) for English only.

    However, XWorkplace is prepared for supporting additional
    languages via additional NLS packages, which are maintained
    and released by people other than me.

    Some are listed on www.xworkplace.org on the download page,
    but you will probably find more up-to-date information about
    NLS packages on the mailing lists (see CONTACT below).


6. GETTING STARTED
==================

    In any case, after installation, open the new "XWorkplace Setup"
    object first and go to the "Features" page. This is the most
    central place to enable XWorkplace features. Press the "Help"
    button there to get more information.
