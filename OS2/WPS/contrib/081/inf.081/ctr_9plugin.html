<BODY>
The &xcenter; was designed to support plug-in DLLs. This allows programmers to add
new widget types (called "widget classes") to the &xcenter; without having to
actually modify &xwp; itself.

<P>As an example, let's say you are the developer of an e-mail program. You could write
a plug-in that periodically checks the user's mail server for new mail. If any is
found, that widget could start flashing, and if the user clicks on it, the e-mail
client would be started to retrieve the new mail.

<P>An &xcenter; widget is basically a PM window class, so anybody who has written a
PM program before should be able to write an &xcenter; plug-in DLL.
You do <I>not</I> need to know WPS and/or SOM programming.

<P>For details, please refer to the <A HREF="095plugins.html">Writing &xcenter; plugins</A>
section.
