        The Order of Menu Items

<!-- Changed with V0.9.0: see notes below -->
<BODY>
<!-- V0.9.0: add the following line -->
<B>Class: XFolder</B><HR>
Since V0.60 you may (finally) change the order of menu items within a context menu
or one of its submenus. (Previously, this was really tiresome to accomplish.)
<P>Simply open the XFolder Configuration Folder or one of its subfolders
<UL><LI>either in <B>Details</B> view
<!-- V0.9.1: changed the following -->
<BR><LI>or in <B>Icon</B> view.
<P>However, this does not work if the Icon view has the icons ordered "as placed". The
icon view needs to be in "flowed" (single column)
or "non-flowed" (multiple columns) mode.
The default configuration folders have this enabled by default, but this
can be set manually on the "View" page in each folder's settings notebook.
(This is more quickly to accomplish with the XFolder "Small icons in icon and tree views"
menu items, by the way.)

</UL>If you now change the order of the objects in this folder with the mouse (drag and drop)
<STRONG>and then</STRONG> close this configuration folder, you will see that the
order of menu items has changed accordingly.
