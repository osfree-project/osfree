<BODY>
The following terms are used throughout this documentation, and you
should therefore be familiar with these.

<UL><LI>An <B>"&xcenter; instance"</B> is an object of the <CODE>&xcenter;</CODE> WPS
class. There can only be one open view per &xcenter; so
that an &xcenter; instance is identical to an &xcenter;
view when it's open, but there can be several &xcenter;
instances on the system (i.e. one for each screen border).

<P>Even though the &xcenter; itself is obviously a Desktop object, it completely
isolates the widgets from the WPS stuff internally. This is why SOM/WPS programming
knowledge is not required to write a new widget class, but you can still do WPS
programming if you want to.

<P><LI>A <B>"widget"</B> is a PM subwindow of an open &xcenter; which
displays something. An open &xcenter; can contain zero,
one, or many widgets. Every &xcenter; keeps a list of
widgets together with their settings in its SOM instance
data. This is totally transparent to the widgets, but if
you are interested, you can view that data on the "Widgets" page
of an &xcenter;'s settings notebook.

<P>Again, to make that clear: A widget is a separate PM window inside the &xcenter;.

<P><LI>A <B>"widget class"</B> defines a widget. Basically, it's a
PM window class with a plain C structure as a wrapper
(<A HREF="plug_9xcenterwidgetclass.html"><CODE>XCENTERWIDGETCLASS</CODE></A>).
This structure holds the name of a PM window class which is used by the &xcenter;
to create the PM widget windows. Depending on the widget
class's attributes, there can be one or several
instances of a widget class. If you want a different widget in the &xcenter;,
you need to write a widget class.

<P>Writing a widget class basically boils down to writing a PM
window class (see below), with some additional rules to follow. To
make things easier, several widget classes can share
the same PM class though.

<P>Some widget classes are built into the &xcenter; itself (i.e. reside in
<CODE>XFLDR.DLL</CODE>), but the &xcenter; can obviously load external plug-in DLLs too.
Several of the widget classes that come with &xwp; have been created as plug-ins to
show you how it's done. If you have the
<A HREF="notices_40source.html">&xwp; source code</A>,
look for the <CODE>src\widgets</CODE> directory.

<P><LI>A <B>"PM window class"</B> is not an &xcenter; definition... this
is explained in detail in the <I>Presentation Manager Programming Reference.</I>

<P>Basically, PM organizes windows into classes. For example, if you create
a PM button, you invoke <CODE>WinCreateWindow</CODE> with the name of the
button window class (<CODE>WC_BUTTON</CODE>), which is a standard window class
of every &os2; system.

<P>It is possible to create new window classes though. The &xcenter; makes use
of this feature to implement widget classes. So again, a widget class is a
PM window class with a bit of extra data to give the &xcenter; more information
about the widgets that can be created of that class.

<P>The advantage of using separate PM window classes is that a widget is essentially
free to do whatever it wants. It can say "Hello world", but it can also choose to
start a dozen subthreads with videos playing.

<P>The disadvantage is that writing a PM window class from scratch is a bit more
difficult than using standard controls. But that's why there are plenty of samples
to learn from.

<P>When a widget is created (either because it is added to an open &xcenter;
or when an &xcenter; is opened in the first place and thus all widgets have to
be created), it does call <CODE>WinCreateWindow</CODE> with the PM window class
name that was specified with the widget class. So this is really not too spectacular.

<P><LI>A <B>"widget plugin DLL"</B> is a separate DLL which resides
in the <CODE>plugins\xcenter</CODE> directory of the &xwp;
installation directory. This must contain one or
several widget classes. There are three procedures that a widget plugin DLL
is required to export to make the &xcenter; see the widget classes. This is
explained in detail on the next pages.
