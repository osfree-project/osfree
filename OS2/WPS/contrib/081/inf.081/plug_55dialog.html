        Step 5: Settings Dialogs
    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<!-- This is all new with V0.9.9. -->
<BODY>
Settings dialogs can be displayed by the &xcenter; to further tune the instance
data of a certain widget. An example of a settings dialog is the "Filter" dialog
displayed by the standard "Window List" widget that comes with &xwp;.

<P>Using settings dialogs requires a bit more setup. The most important thing
to remember is that the &xcenter; does <I>not</I> invoke a settings dialog on
an open &xcenter; widget, but on a <I>setup string</I> only.

<!-- V0.9.14: changed the following -->
<P>This was done so that settings dialogs can be displayed for a widget even
if that widget is not currently visible (i.e. doesn't currently exist as
a window). This allows the &xcenter; to display the settings dialog from both
the "Properties" menu item in a widget's context menu and from a widget's
context menu on the "Widgets" page in the &xcenter; settings notebook --
even if the &xcenter; isn't currently open.
<!-- end V0.9.14 -->

<P>Basically, to support settings dialogs, your widget class must do the following:

<OL><LI>In the widget class definition
(<A HREF="plug_9xcenterwidgetclass.html"><CODE>XCENTERWIDGETCLASS</CODE></A>), set
the <CODE>pShowSettingsDlg</CODE> field to the function in your DLL which can
display the settings dialog.

<P>This function must have the following prototype:

<P><CODE>typedef VOID EXPENTRY ShowSettingsDialog(PWIDGETSETTINGSDLGDATA pData);</CODE>

<P><LI>When the &xcenter; needs to invoke the settings dialog (e.g. because the "Properties"
menu item was selected), it will call exactly this function, which should do a
standard <CODE>WinDlgBox</CODE> and not return until the dialog has been
dismissed ("OK" or "Cancel" were pressed).

<P>That function receives a pointer to a temporary
<A HREF="plug_9widgetsettingsdlgdata.html"><CODE>WIDGETSETTINGSDLGDATA</CODE></A>
structure, which the &xcenter; has composed for the settings dialog. In there, the
settings dialog can find out whether the widget is currently visible.

</OL>For details, please look at the "Window list" source code in <CODE>src\widgets</CODE>
in the &xwp; sources.
