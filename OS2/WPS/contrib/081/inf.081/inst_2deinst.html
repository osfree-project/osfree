<!-- the following paragraph was added with V0.9.2 -->
There are several ways to de-install &xwp;.

<!-- the following paragraph was added with V0.9.2 -->
<UL><LI><B>The easy way.</B>

<P>Since &xwp; now uses WarpIN for <A HREF="inst_1inst.html">installation</A>,
it now uses WarpIN for de-installation also. Either double-click on the WarpIN
program object and select the &xwp; package(s) for de-installation, or
double-click on the &xwp; archive again, both of which will de-install
&xwp;.

<!-- the following (up to end note) was added with V0.9.1 -->

</UL>In case WarpIN is unable to de-install &xwp; (or you don't trust WarpIN
to do the job right), you can <B>manually de-install &xwp;.</B>

<UL><LI><B>The clean way.</B>

<P>&xwp;'s installation is entirely based on WPS classes. If you deregister
all of &xwp;'s classes, you'll get your regular &os2; Workplace Shell back.
You don't have to undo any &cfgsys; changes, because there are none.

<P>However, before deregistering classes, you should undo all of &xwp;'s
class replacements. So this is a two-step process (you can use the "WPS Class List"
object for this):

<BR><OL><LI><B>Undo</B> all the following class <B>replacements</B> (if present):

<UL><LI>XFldObject, replacing WPObject
<LI>XFolder, replacing WPFolder
<LI>XFldDataFile, replacing WPDataFile
<LI>XFldDisk, replacing WPDisk
<LI>XFldDesktop, replacing WPDesktop
<LI>XWPProgramFile, replacing WPProgramFile
<LI>XWPSound, replacing WPSound
<LI>XWPMouse, replacing WPMouse
<LI>XWPKeyboard, replacing WPKeyboard
</UL>

<LI><B>Deregister</B> all the X* classes listed above.

<P><LI>In addition, <B>deregister</B> the following (if present):

<UL><LI>XFldSystem
<LI>XFldWPS
<LI>XFldStartup
<LI>XFldShutdown
<LI>XWPSetup
<LI>XWPClassList
<LI>XWPTrashCan
<LI>XWPTrashObject
</UL>

<LI>Then <B>restart the WPS.</B> &xwp; should be gone.

<P><LI>&xwp; has created a few sections in your OS2.INI file. You can safely
delete all sections starting with "&xwp;", but only do this if you're sure
you don't want to re-install &xwp;, because all your settings will get lost.
</OL>

<LI><B>The ugly way.</B> This is the "emergency exit" in case your computer isn't
working at all any more. This is not recommended and only given as a last resort.

<BR><OL><LI>Reboot your computer and press Alt-F1 while the little "OS/2" box is showing.
Open a command line from the "Recovery choices" menu.

<P><LI>From the command line, rename the &xwp; directory (the parent directory
of the <CODE>BIN</CODE> directory with <CODE>XFLDR.DLL</CODE>.

<P><LI>Reboot. When the Desktop starts up, it will not find the &xwp; classes
(in <CODE>XFLDR.DLL</CODE>), because the directory specified when registering
the classes is now invalid. You should get a clean WPS this way too. Note however
that this does not unreplace or deregister the &xwp; classes!
</OL>
</UL>

<!-- end of V0.9.1 addition -->
If you wish to remove &xwp; because you don't consider it to be of any use for you,
that's fine.

<P>However, if you remove it because it does not seem to be working right or messes up your
system, please <A HREF="notices_3comments.html">contact the developer's
team,</A> so we can improve it.
