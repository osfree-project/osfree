Per default, the &xcenter; comes with the following widget types:

<UL><LI>The <B>"X-Button"</B> widget. This displays the &xwp; "X" logo on
the &xcenter; bar. If you click on that button, a menu opens which gives you access
to the "Suspend", "Restart Desktop", and &xshutdown; features. In addition, this displays
the folder contents of the Desktop.

<BR><IMG SRC="ctr_x.gif">

<P><LI><B>Object buttons.</B> These represent any Desktop object. These widgets are
not displayed in the "Add widgets" menu. To add such a widget,
simply drag it onto the &xcenter; bar, as shown on the
<A HREF="ctr_2addwgt.html">previous page</A>.

<P>If the object is a folder, it will display its contents, if you click on it,
similar to the XFolder <A HREF="menu_6favorite.html">folder content menus</A>:

<P><LI>The <B>"CPU load"</B> widget can also be seen in the above screenshot and presents
the current CPU load as a per-cent value. In addition, it maintains a graph of past
CPU activity.

<P><LI>Then there are several monitor widgets which display system information. Presently,
we have a <B>clock</B> and a <B>"free memory" widget:</B>

<P><LI>Finally, the <B>"Window list"</B> widget displays the contents of the PM window list.
As opposed to that list, the currently active window is shown as a pushed-down
button, and you can click on the items to active the corresponding window. Besides,
the window list supports filtering (right-click on the window list and select
"Properties").
