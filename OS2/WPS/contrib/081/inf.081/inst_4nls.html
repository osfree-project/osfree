<!-- V1.0.1: all the following rewritten -->
&xwp; is capable of supporting languages other than English, even though per
default it comes with English National Language Support (NLS).
For those languages however, you will need an
<B>&xwp; NLS package.</B> Such a package will
contain only the language-specific files for a specific languages.

<P>Please check <a href="http://www.xworkplace.org">http://www.xworkplace.org</a>
for available NLS packages. I only maintain English myself, but I try to keep
track of the translations done by other people as time permits.

<P>Note that NLS packages are version specific. That is, for a given &xwp;
version, install only a matching NLS package, or &xwp; might malfunction
more or less badly.
<!-- end V1.0.1 -->

<!-- all the following with V0.9.0 -->
<P>NLS packages are installed using WarpIN too. If you wish to use a language other
than English, after &xwp; has been installed,
do not restart your computer yet, but install your NLS package next.
Then restart the WPS.

<P>When several languages are installed, the
<A HREF="sys_1intro.html">"&xwp; Setup" object</A> offers you a
"Language" drop-down box to change the current language.
