<!-- this file is all new with V0.83; -->
<!-- changed with V0.85 -->
<!-- Note: I won't recommend to translate this file. The people I'm  -->
<!-- addressing here need to speak English anyway, so don't bother. -->
<!-- Simply copy this most current version over your existing one. -->
<!-- Changed with V0.9.0: replace XFolder with &xwp; -->
<BODY>
If you like &xwp; and would like to contribute to it, your support will
be very welcome. &xwp; is slowly beginning to become too complex to be handled by
one person all alone.

<!-- V0.9.1: removed this:
You don't have to be a programmer to help. Support is appreciated in the
following areas (and others): -->

<UL><LI><B>Translations.</B> &xwp; is designed to be translateable in a fairly
easy way. All language-dependent parts have been separated from the actual
"intelligence" of the program into separate files, which can be translated independently.
<P>If you're interested in <B>translating &xwp; to your language,</B>
you can simply download the &xwp; sources from my homepage, which contain everything
necessary for this.
You don't have to be a programmer to do this, but
it would be of great help if you have a basic knowledge of HTML,
since both &xwp;'s Online Reference and the help
file were originally written in HTML and then simply
converted to the IBM format, which I dislike very much.
<P>In this case, please
contact me, so I can add you to
my mailing list to allow you to get news about changes in time.

<!-- this paragraph removed with V0.85 -->
<!-- Documentation. I am looking for someone to take over maintenance of -->
<!-- the XFolder INF and HLP files. It just takes too much time away from programming to -->
<!-- always have to add documentation while adding new features, and I tend to overlook -->
<!-- stuff sometimes. This applies especially to the German documentation. -->
<!-- So if you know German and/or English and HTML, please -->
<!-- contact me. -->

<P><LI>If you're a programmer and have some experience in <B>PM and/or WPS programming,</B>
please contact me also. We have great plans for &xwp;'s future
<!-- V0.9.1: removed this:
and would like to turn it into more of an "&xwp;" package -->
to overcome the most obvious WPS limitations
which exist today. Since there's little hope that IBM will do anything about this,
I believe the &os2; community needs to do it themselves.
The following major things are on the to-do list:
<!-- V0.9.1: removed this : (I am not listing the "little" features
that I'll add myself soon): -->

<BR><OL><LI><B>WPS file handling.</B> This needs some serious reworking. I cannot
believe that the WPS hangs every other time one copies more than a dozen files.
File handling is the main task of an operating system's shell, and the current
implementation needs at least the following enhancements: thread-safety, speed,
proper progress bars when copying, a "Cancel" button that's not always disabled,
more meaningful error messages etc.pp. This will require all of the WPS file-handling
methods to be reworked (<CODE>wpCopy</CODE>, <CODE>wpMove</CODE> etc.).

<!-- V0.9.13: removed this
<P><LI><B>Populating folders.</B> One of the reasons that the WPS
has become so much slower
in &warp4; is that the WPS now seems to create object handles for
every single file while populating a folder, which wasn't the case with Warp 3.
Object handles are a thoughtful mechanism which is necessary for program objects and
shadows, but they should only be created when necessary. I suspect this misbehavior
is situated in <CODE>wpPopulate</CODE>, which therefore needs some rework too.
-->

<P><LI><B>Icon handling.</B> Drag'n'drop in the WPS always causes icons to be arranged
in a fairly random way. This should be improved.

<P><LI><B>WPProgram.</B> I have never understood why there's an object for global
DOS/&winos2; settings if the program objects don't respect the settings there. We need
support for global settings and also global and individual environment variables
in program objects so that &cfgsys; does not always have to be modified.

<P><LI><B>&warpcenter;.</B> That thing is instable, slow, and does not conform very well
with the rest of the WPS. This should be completely reprogrammed. Since &xwp; already
has code for those "folder content" menus, this shouldn't be too hard to to.

<P><LI><B>Multi-user support.</B> The WPS is already designed to support multiple
users thru the use of multiple OS2.INI files and Desktop hierarchies, so I cannot
quite understand why IBM is not implementing this. &xwp; could do this; I am thinking
of replacing the PROTSHELL and/or RUNWORKPLACE statements in &cfgsys; with some
&xwp; executable,
which will then start PMSHELL.EXE with a bunch of preset environment variables, most
importantly OS2.INI settings and a UNIX-like HOME environment variable to support multiple
configurations for applications in a "home" directory for each user.
&xwp; should then offer a context menu item to "logoff" or something.

<P><LI>&os2; also needs to be able to <B>restart Presentation Manager</B> somehow
without having to
reboot, for example to change display resolutions. The current solution is a joke.
If you have any ideas about this, especially how to terminate and restart PM without
blocking the system, please
contact me.

</OL><P>So if you're interested in adding any of these features to &xwp;
(or if you have other suggestions), you'd be very welcome to join the project!
Any help is appreciated.
