<BODY>
Well, there are a lot of people to thank... &xwp; is still a fairly young piece
of software, but still so many people have sent in remarks and supported me.
You are too many to be mentioned here separately.
If you don't find your name in this list, please feel addressed
with this global thank you! Without all this support, &xwp; wouldn't be
where it is today.

<!-- V1.0.1: this goes to you, guys -->

the huge effort of making &xwp; available in many languages!

<P>The following people deserve a big thank you for contributing to &xwp;:

could finally replace the &xshutdown; save-INI routines, and for finding some bugs
