&xwp; offers you a variety of enhancements to the Desktop startup
and shutdown processes. This is explained in detail on the following
pages.

<P><B>Notes:</B>

<OL><LI>All these features are disabled per default and have to
be enabled individually on the "Features" page of the
<A HREF="sys_2global.html">"&xwp; Setup"</A> object.
In order to implement these features, quite a number of changes had to
be made to some core functions of the Workplace Shell. So if something
is not working right, you can selectively enable/disable each feature.

<P><LI>&xwp; now has a <B>"Startup panic" dialog</B> which is displayed
if you hold down the <B>"Shift" key</B> while the WPS is starting up.
<P>So if you enable some startup feature and your WPS hangs at startup,
press Ctrl+Alt+Del and hold down the "Shift" key when the system switches
to graphics mode until the dialog appears.
<P>This dialog allows you to temporarily disable certain &xwp; startup
features and then continue booting. This will not change the &xwp; global
settings, but only skip certain functions during startup. You can then
change the respective &xwp; settings after the system has started.
