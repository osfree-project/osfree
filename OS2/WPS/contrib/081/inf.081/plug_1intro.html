The &xcenter; supports widget plug-in DLLs. To the &xcenter;, it doesn't matter whether
a widget class is built into <CODE>XFLDR.DLL</CODE> itself or implemented externally
through a plug-in DLL.
See <A HREF="ctr_9plugin.html">"About plug-in DLLs"</A> for a general introduction
to this feature of the &xcenter;.

<P>The existing <A HREF="ctr_3stdwgt.html">standard widget classes</A> are partly
built into <CODE>XFLDR.DLL</CODE> itself (if they make extensive use of WPS features,
such as with the object button widget), but some of them are already implemented as
plug-in DLLs. This was done for two reasons: first, to test that the plug-in
DLL interface actually works, and second, to give potential developers the chance
to look at how this can be done.

<P>Please read through the <A HREF="plug_2terminology.html">Terminology</A> section
first to make sure you know about the wording used here.

<P>Then, basically, you can start with the minimal widget which comes with the
&xwp; binary release. In this case, you do not even need the &xwp;
source code. All you need is the &xcenter; include file, which now comes with &xwp;
(see <CODE>toolkit\center.h</CODE>).

<P>See <A HREF="plug_51simple.html">Step 1: One header only</A>
for an introduction, which gets more complicated with the following steps.
