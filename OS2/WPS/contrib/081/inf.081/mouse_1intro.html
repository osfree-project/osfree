Starting with V0.9.0, &xwp; also introduces a number of mouse and
keyboard enhancements by installing a Presentation Manager hook, similar
to what well-known enhancers such as FeelX, NPS WPS, and WarpEnhancer do.
<P>
So &xwp; now also goes for features like "sliding focus", "hot corners",
and "object hotkeys". These are described in detail on the following pages.
<P>
The ultimate goal for this &xwp; component is to replace all those PM hook
utilities one day. In my view, several problems exist with those utilities:

<OL><LI>Most importantly, most of these have not been actively maintained for
years. This especially applies to FeelX and NPS WPS, both of which I have been
using for years. However, both of them have a few limitations which will never
be overcome because they probably won't ever be updated again.

<P><LI>Both utilities are not well integrated into the WPS. That is, their settings
cannot be changed using the standard WPS notebooks. &xwp; allows you to
configure its PM hook using the "Mouse" and "Keyboard" objects in the
"System Setup" folder. And NPS WPS always terminates itself when the WPS
is restarted, which is pretty annoying.

<P><LI>None of the well-known PM hook utilities are OpenSource, except
ProgramCommander/2 (which is even public domain). &xwp; is OpenSource,
so bugs can be reported and/or fixed by users.

<P><LI>Finally, I just hate to install three different PM hooks when I only
need a single feature from each of these. Each installed PM hook slows down
the system, because every single message which is produced by &os2; and posted
or sent to a window must go thru all of these hooks, each of which does a
lot of calculations for that message. And we're talking about possibly hundreds
of messages per second here. So instead of having three hooks installed
which are only partly used, &xwp; attempts to put the most frequently-used
features all together in one hook.

</OL>Note that the &xwp; PM hook is a completely optional feature. If you
don't like it and prefer to still use other utilites, feel free to do so.

<P>For this reason, the &xwp; hook is disabled per default.
It must be enabled first in the "&xwp; Setup" object.
