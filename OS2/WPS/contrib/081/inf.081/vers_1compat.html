<!-- Changed with V0.9.0: replace XFolder with &xwp;; also see notes below -->
<BODY>
As you might have experienced, sometimes several WPS enhancers don't seem to like each other
too much. Or maybe they do like each other, but just don't get along.
<P>However, I have tested &xwp; with several system utilities that I could
reach at this time
(on both Warp 3 and 4), and a number of users reported other utilities to me.
The following programs
seemed to be cooperative:
<UL>
<LI>CandyBarZ 1.01 / 1.10
<LI>CommandFolder 1.50
<!-- next item changed with V0.81 -->
<LI>Desktop Wizard 1.41 (mind the notes below)
<LI>DragText 2.5
<LI>Extended Desktop 1.4
<LI>FeelX (installs a WPS class)
<!-- next item changed with V0.9.0 -->
<LI>Hot Scroll 0.80 / 1.00 / 1.10
<LI>NPS WPS 1.81 / 1.82 (mind the notes below)
<!-- next item changed with V0.9.0 -->
<LI>Object Desktop Professional 1.5.2 / 2.0 (mind the notes below)
<LI>WatchCat 2.1 (installs a WPS class)
<LI>WPAnimatedMousePointer 1.01
<LI>X.file 1.1 / 1.2
<LI>X.it 2.4 / 2.5

</UL><B>General note.</B> As &xwp; is providing more features with
every released version, chances increase that features conflict with other
parties' WPS replacement classes.
Depending on which software was installed first (and thus appears first
in the WPS class replacement list), &xwp; or the other product may not get a chance
to actually change the WPS's behavior.
<P>Moreover, since &xwp; offers a number of features which are also contained in
other WPS packages (mostly PM hooks), you should make sure that these features are
not enabled in several packages at the same time.
For example, you should not enable folder status bars in
both &xwp; and Object Desktop, which can only lead to
<!-- V0.9.0: added the following -->
problems, or activate the
&xwp; trash can while another trash can software is also installed.

<P><B>Warnings.</B> The following list of incompatibilities is based on
reports by users of &xwp;. I have not verified these yet and include them only
to save you from trouble.

<!--- the following updated with V0.84 -->
<UL><LI><B>Object Desktop.</B> OD manipulates the WPS just as intensively as
&xwp; does (maybe even more), so it's just natural that most problems have arised
with this software.
<P><B>Note:</B> I do not have Object Desktop. The following is all I know. If you find out
something, you're welcome to tell me, and I'll add that to this section.
But please do not write me that OD does
not cooperate well with &xwp;.
<I>I know,</I> and there's little I can do about it.
<P>For all versions, the following rule applies: If you have trouble,
&xwp; probably conflicts with OD's folder replacement class, TSEnhFolder.
If nothing else works, you can always deregister that class (using the
&xwp; "WPS Class list" object),
<!-- V0.9.0: remove this: in the "Workplace Shell" object), -->
and you'll probably get &xwp; to work.
<P>But before that, mind the following notes:
<!-- V0.9.6: remove the following
The install program now offers you to alter the order of &xwp; and
the "TSEnhFolder" class in the WPS class list
which is the WPS class responsible for most of the Object Desktop folder functions.
I believe this should help, because then &xwp; gets the chance to subclass
the folder windows before Object Desktop. -->

<!-- added the headline with V0.84 -->
<!-- changed the headline with V0.9.0 -->
<P><B>All Object Desktop versions.</B>
<!-- the following is unchanged -->
<P>I was reported that &xwp; does not cooperate with the <B>"Browse mode"</B>
feature of Object Desktop. You will have to switch this feature off, sorry.

<P>Also, you should make sure to have the <B>"Folder status bars"</B> disabled
in Object Desktop before enabling the respective &xwp; function, or the funniest
things might happen.

<P>Finally, I was reported that XFolder keeps adding status bars to Object Desktop's
<B>"Launchpads"</B> even where they don't belong. Apparently, these things are
derived from the WPFolder class also; they have a "View" page in their settings
notebooks though, so you can turn off XFolder's status bars for them.
<!-- V0.9.6: added this -->
If the object doesn't have a "View" page, you can try to manually use the
<CODE>STATUSBAR=NO</CODE> folder setup string <!-- V0.9.16: removed link here -->
of the XFolder class.

<!-- added the following with V0.84 -->
<P><B>Object Desktop 2.0.</B>
<A HREF="mailto:e9425324@student.tuwien.ac.at">Stefan Zechmeister</A>
got OD 2.0 to work with &xwp; doing this:
<OL><LI>Install OD 2.0.
<LI>Install OD fixkit #1.
<LI>Install &xwp;.
<!-- V0.9.6: removed this: Reverse the order of TSEnhFolder class as proposed by
the install script. -->
<!-- V0.9.0: changed the following -->
<LI>Go to the "&xwp; Setup" object, "Paranoia" page, and raise the
"Menu item ID offset" to 700 or above. Starting with V0.9.0, the default is now 700.
</OL>If you then move &xwp;'s installation folder to another
folder, make sure the target folder has OD's extra features turned off.
Otherwise &xwp; will complain that its Configuration Folder does not
exist.

<!-- the following is unchanged -->
<BR><LI>If you are using <B>NPS WPS,</B> you must make sure to have its
"Select by name" and "Sort by extension" features disabled, because &xwp; offers
these features also and gets confused if these features are added by NPS WPS also.

<P>&xwp; does <I>not</I> work with the automatic menu selection of NPS WPS, at least
not if you are using the "Folder content" functions. This might lead to bad PM hangs.
<!-- V0.9.6: added this -->
Use &xwp;'s "Sliding menu" feature instead.

<BR><LI>I was reported that &xwp; seems to have problems cooperating with
<B>Program Commander/2.</B> Apparently, this can be solved by switching off
the "SmartIcons" feature for title bars.

<BR><LI>&xwp; also seemed to have problems with <B>DragText</B> on some systems.
There must be a setting somewhere in that software to start DragText delayed, which
should solve this.

<BR><LI>I was told by Hauke Laging that
<B>Extended Clipboard (EClip)</B> by Hinnerk Becker
does not cooperate with &xwp;.
On Hauke's Warp 4 system, the WPS hung at startup and did not
respond to anything. Hauke then told me that the problem can be resolved by
removing EClip from the startup folder. (I was unable to reproduce all this,
but I'm reporting this to you anyway.)

<BR><LI>Several users also reported that the "Snap to grid" function did not seem
to work. I have tested both Warp 3 and 4 and encountered no problems; these users
all had some version of Object Desktop installed, so I suspect in respect to the
"Snap to grid" feature, &xwp; and Object Desktop seem to be colliding somehow.

<BR><LI>Bernd Schemmer reported that &xwp; seems to be using the same menu ID's as the <B>LAN
Server GUI</B>. If you're using LAN Server (or other software
that might suffer from this), you can now change &xwp;'s menu IDs
<!-- V0.9.0: change "Workplace Shell" to "&xwp; Setup" -->
in the <A HREF="sys_2global.html">"&xwp; Setup"</A> object. The default menu ID offset
has now (V0.51) been raised from 100 to 300 to avoid these conflicts.

<BR><LI>Michael Holzapfel reported that installing GRADD drivers for the
<B>ELSA Winner 2000FC</B> video card
crashed his system when &xwp; V0.71 was installed, causing a CHKDSK at
the next reboot, which in turn damaged the newly installed drivers, so the system
wouldn't start at all. He told me that de-installing &xwp; helped.

<!-- this item added with V0.81 -->
<BR><LI>Dirk Schulz reported that Desktop Wizard and &xwp; don't like each other
too much. On his system, he was able to increase the WPS's stability by de-installing
Desktop Wizard. Glad he didn't de-install &xwp;. ;-)

<!-- V0.9.13: added this -->
<P>I was also reported that Prompt ver. 1.12 by Gary L. Robinson, which appears to
implement a subset of the Desktop Wizard features, appears to work fine though.
