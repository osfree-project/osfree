<BODY>
&xwp; can replace the default Workplace Shell file associations mechanism.
<!-- V1.0.1 (2002-12-15) [umoeller] replaced this -->
To use them, enable the <a href="fldr_30turbo.html">"Turbo folders"</a> feature on the "Features"
page of the <A HREF="sys_2global.html">"&xwp; Setup"</A> object.

<P>As you probably know, per default the WPS associates programs to data files
using two mechanisms: "associations by file type" and "associations by file filter".

<P>If &xwp;'s extended file associations are enabled, you will <I>only</I> have
associations by file type.

<P><I>However,</I> since most files do not have an explicit file type set (which can
be done on the "Type" page in a file's settings notebook), &xwp; will automatically
assign file types to file objects according to file filters. This way you get the best
of both worlds (file types and file filters) in a more logical way.

<P>So what is this good for?

<P>For one, I have found the standard WPS association mechanism slightly awkward if
associations are added according to both file filters and file types. The new
approach is more logical in this sense.

<P>Secondly, and most importantly, &xwp; allows you to define
<B>file type hierarchies.</B> For example, there are many file types which are
really "plain text" files also (for example, "C Code" or "HTML" files), so any editor
which can read "plain text" should be able to read those file types also.

<P>Until now, you had to associate the same editor to all those file types.
With &xwp;, you can now define any type to be a "sub-type" of "plain text",
and that sub-type will <B>inherit</B> the associations defined for the parent type.

<P>This can be done on the new "File types" page in the
<A HREF="sys_2global.html">"Workplace Shell" object</A>
(if extended associations have been enabled):

<P><IMG SRC="filetypes.gif">

<P>To define file type hierarchies, simply <B>drag and drop</B> the file types
in the "File types" tree onto another file type.
&xwp; allows you to <B>import</B> your old file filters into the new
associations. To do this, right-click into the "Filters" field and select
"Import".
