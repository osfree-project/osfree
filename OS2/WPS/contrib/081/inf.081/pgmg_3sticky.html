A <B>sticky window</B> is a window that is always visible on all desktops. While
this may seem to be "wasting space", sticky windows can be very useful.

<P>There are some applications which are small in screen space consumption,
such as clocks, resource monitors, program launchers,
which you might prefer to see on all desktops. You can therefore declare them
as sticky on the &pgr; settings pages in the
<A HREF="sys_1intro.html">"Screen" settings object.</A>

<!-- V0.9.4: added the following paragraph -->
<P>&pgr; identifies a window as sticky according to its
switch list title. For details, refer to the help page on the settings page in the
<A HREF="sys_1intro.html">"Screen" settings object.</A>

<P>There are two windows that are always sticky: the &pgr; window itself,
and the Workplace Shell Desktop.

<!-- V0.9.4: added all the following -->
Besides, minimized windows are always sticky if you have configured minimized
windows to appear on the Desktop.
