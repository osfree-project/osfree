        Extended Sort Options

<!-- Changed with V0.9.0: replace XFolder with &xwp;; also see notes below -->

<!-- V0.9.0: add the following line -->
<B>Class: XFolder</B><HR>
&xwp; can also enhance the "Sort" functions of the Workplace Shell.
<P><B>Important note:</B> In order to avoid confusion, the sort extensions are
disabled by default. You can enable them in the
<A HREF="sys_2global.html">"&xwp; Setup" object</A>.

<!-- V0.9.1: removed all this:
After you enable the new sort functions, your previous folder sort settings will
get lost successively as the WPS activates folders. Unfortunately, this is inevitable,
because IBM has barely documented at all how the WPS sort functions are working
internally. As a result, you'll
have to reconfigure the sort settings for certain folders (which will be explained below). -->
<P>The new &xwp; sort features are:

<UL><LI>Finally, there are <B>global sort settings,</B>
which previously did not exist in the WPS.
While it was possible to set a number of folder settings globally, until now sorting could
only be influenced for each individual folder, which was quite annoying. &xwp;
introduces a "Sort" page to the
<A HREF="sys_2global.html">"Workplace Shell" object</A> for global sort settings,
which can be overridden individually for
each folder.

<BR><LI>&xwp; also gets rid of some of the strange sort settings which nobody used
anyway, such as the "sort class". (This setting did not make much sense, because
WPFolder is the only class which introduces meaningful sort criteria anyway.)

<!-- V0.9.13: rewrote all the following -->
<BR><LI>Most importantly, &xwp; gives you lots of new sort options for folders
-- both for each individual folder and globally through the "Sort" page in the
<A HREF="sys_2global.html">"Workplace Shell" object</A>.

<P>For one, <B>new sort criteria</B> such as "object class" and "file name extension" have
been introduced.

<P>Secondly, there is now a new "super-criterion" for always <B>sorting folders first,</B>
in addition to the folder's default sort criterion. For example,
you can sort by size and still have all folders sorted to the top.

<P>For all this, the <B>"Sort" submenu</B> in each folder context menu has been reworked too:

<P><IMG SRC="sort.gif">

<BR>As you can see, &xwp; adds menu items for "Always maintain sort order"
and "Sort folders first" for quick access.

<P>In addition, you can quickly change the default sort criterion for a
certain folder by <B>holding down the "Shift"</B> key while selecting a sort criterion
in the "Sort" menu.

</UL>&xwp; also defines
<A HREF="fldr_5xelerators.html">folder hotkeys</A> for the most frequently
used sort criteria.
