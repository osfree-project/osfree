        Replacing Folder Auto-Refresh

<!-- This is all new with V0.9.9. -->

Starting with V0.9.9, &xwp; can replace the Workplace Shell's folder auto-refresh
mechanism.

<P>You are probably familiar with this feature of the Workplace Shell. If you have
a folder open and manipulate files in that folder from the command line, you will
see that the WPS magically will know about these modifications and refresh the folder
automatically.

<P>While this is a great feature in theory, there are severe limitations with the
standard implementation of this in the WPS. Most importantly, the WPS will create
excessive file-system handles for all objects that are auto-refreshed, which will
unnecessarily blow up your INI files. Note that this even happens if you have the
<CODE>AUTOREFRESHFOLDERS=NO</CODE> setting in your &cfgsys; file.

<P>&xwp; can now replace this entire mechanism if you have enabled this replacement
on the "Features" page in the <A HREF="sys_2global.html">"&xwp; Setup" object.</A>

<P>If the replacement is enabled, &xwp; will prevent the internal WPS threads
which are responsible for folder auto-refresh from running. Among other things, this
will prevent file-system handles from being created. Instead, &xwp; will start
its own threads which will start monitoring file-system activity and automatically
refresh folders then.

<P>Note that as a result, enabling or disabling the replacement requires a Desktop restart
because &xwp; can only do this replacement while the WPS is starting up.

<P>However, once the replacement has been enabled and the WPS has been restarted,
you can enable and disable folder auto-refresh on the "View" page in the
"Workplace Shell" object without having to restart the WPS.
