<!-- V0.9.0: add the following line -->
<B>Class: XFolder</B><HR>
In the default configuration, the <B>"Create another"</B> context submenu contains
items for creating Desktop objects. By selecting one of the items in this submenu,
XFolder will create a new object in the folder whose context menu was used.
<P>Per default, if the folder is open, XFolder will make the title of the
new object editable, just as if you had clicked on it with the Alt key pressed:
<BR><IMG SRC="titleedit.gif">
<P>However, if you hold down the <B>Shift key</B> while selecting
the menu item, XFolder will automatically open the Settings notebook of
the new object after creation.

<!-- this paragraph added with V0.81 -->
<P>You can change this behavior on the
"Context menus" pages in the new
<A HREF="sys_2global.html">"Workplace Shell"</A> object.
