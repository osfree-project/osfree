; xfldr049.def:
;       module definition file for XWorkplace resource DLL (German).
;       A module definition file contains information which is needed
;       after code modules have been compiled and need to be linked
;       together.
;       You must change the "XFLDR001" string just below to the file
;       name that the NLS DLL will carry (for example, "XFLDR039" for
;       Italian).
;       You can also change the DESCRIPTION string, but this is not
;       evaluated by XWorkplace.
;       Do not change anything else.
