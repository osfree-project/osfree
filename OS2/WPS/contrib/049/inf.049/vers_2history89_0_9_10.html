<B>&xwp; 0.9.10 (April 16, 2001)</B>

<P>Bugfixes:
<UL><LI>Fixed an ugly memory management bug which caused the internal DosQProcStat
wrappers to trap on some systems... This was mostly seen on the "Threads" page in
XWPSetup.
<P><LI>"Modules" page displayed nothing for some exports with names &gt; 127 chars.
Also added some support for Windows executables.
<P><LI>Enabling the trash can on the XWPSetup "Features" page caused the font folder
to be created. Fixed.
<P><LI>&pgr; no longer recognized the Desktop on some systems. Fixed, I hope.
<P><LI>&xcenter; tooltips never appeared on systems where Styler/2 was installed.
Implemented a fix suggested by Alessandro Cantatore.
<P><LI>System sounds page didn't work if MMPM/2 wasn't installed in ?:\MMOS2. Fixed,
I hope.
