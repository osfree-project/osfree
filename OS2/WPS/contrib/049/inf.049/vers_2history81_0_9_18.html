<B>&xwp; 0.9.18 (March 26, 2002)</B>

<P>New features:

<UL><LI>Mouse: Paul Ratcliffe added the "Screen wrap" feature a la NPSWPS
to the special actions for screen borders.

<P><LI>&pgr;: Holding down the "Shift" key while dragging mini-windows in
the pager window now drags across virtual screens, keeping the window's position.
Thanks, Martin Lafaix.

</UL>Miscellaneous changes:

<UL><LI>Object button widgets are no longer shown in the "Add widget" menu since
they were always disabled anyway.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Now painting bottom 3D color in black for better contrast.

<P><LI>Saved a precious PM timer in the Worker thread that was used for
close to nothing.

<P><LI>PageMage was renamed to &pgr;. This requires also that you reconfigure
the pager settings, unfortunately.

</UL>Bugfixes:

<UL><LI>Common: Fixed another problem with AM/PM (12-hour) time display, which
always ended up with "00:" when "12:" should have been displayed.

<P><LI>File pages replacement: Now refreshing page when page is turned back to.

<P><LI>Program objects: Fixed a bunch of problems with programs not
remembering setting changes and the bug that program objects could no longer
be properly created at all.
That was a hard one. Added exception handling to a number of replacement
methods too since apparently the code crashed sometimes. Parts of this code
were and are active even if extended associations were disabled.

<P><LI>Programs: Fixed memory problems with my WinStartApp wrapper which
sometimes ate parts of the environment of the process to be started. (The
code was and is active only if extended associations are enabled.)

<P><LI>Programs: Fixed hangs with VIO programs when not started from thread 1.

<P><LI>Folder sorting / status bars: Hopefully fixed the mysterious scroll bars
that would pop up in folder icon views (in "as placed" mode) if "always sort"
was off for a folder.

<P><LI>Turbo folders: Miscellanous fixes for thread synchronization problems which
could lead to duplicate objects for the same file.

<P><LI>Icon replacements: Fixed missing icons with PMMail attachments display.

<P><LI>Icon replacements: Implemented wpQueryIconData everywhere so that
"Edit icon" and drag'n'drop show the replacement icons too.

<P><LI>Icon replacements: Custom icons in the .ICON EA were ignored always and
overridden by association icon. Fixed.

<P><LI>Icon replacements: Fixed several places where the WPS succeeded in killing
my shared icons, resulting in blank icons for a whole bunch of objects.

<P><LI>File dialog: Large number of fixes for duplicate objects in tree view plus
frequent bad scrolling.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Knut St. Osmundsen fixed a bunch of display problems introduced
with the recent SMP update. He reported this now works fine on SMP. Display
looks much better now.

<P><LI>&pgr;: Martin Lafaix fixed a large number of glitches with &pgr;'s display
plus some problems with minimized/maximized windows.
