<!--
    XWPUSERS:
        this file holds login information for all users
        which are recognized by XWorkplace Security.
        The default version in the install\ subdirectory
        of the XWorkplace installation directory is copied
        to the ?:\OS2 directory.

        This file uses an XML-like syntax for user
        specifications.

    USER SPECIFICATIONS

        USER
                NAME="username"
                USERID=id
                PASS="password"
                GROUPID="id[,id...]
                [HOMEDIR="x:\homedirspec"]
                [USERINI="x:\path\xxx.ini"]
                [XWPSHELL="[path]\xxx.exe"]
                [COMSPEC="[path]\xxx.exe"]
        Real Name /USER

        The following are required for each user:

        NAME="username"     the user name (login).
        USERID=id           the decimal user ID for this user. This must be
                            unique.
        PASS="password"     the user's password.
        GROUPID="id[,id...]" the ID (or ID's) of the group(s) this user belongs
                            to. This references one of the GROUP tags. There
                            must be at least one group, but the user may belong
                            to several.
                            Note: This is different from UNIX. There, each user
                            has a "primary" group and can belong to several
                            others as well, but only the primary group is
                            specified in /etc/passwd.

        The following are optional for each user:

        HOMEDIR=dir         full path specification of the home directory.
                            If this is not specified, this defaults to
                            $(XWPHOME)\username. If XWPHOME is not specified
                            in CONFIG.SYS, XWPHOME defaults to ?:\home on the
                            boot drive.
        USERINI=ini         full path specification of the user profile (OS2.INI)
                            for this user. If this is not specified, this defaults
                            to OS2.INI in the home directory (except for "root").
                            By specifying the same OS2.INI for several users,
                            several users can share the same desktop directory.
        XWPSHELL=exe        shell to use for this user. If this is not specified,
                            this defaults to $(XWPSHELL). If XWPSHELL is not
                            specified in CONFIG.SYS, XWPSHELL defaults to
                            ?:\OS2\PMSHELL.EXE on the boot drive.
                            If the executable is on the PATH, the full path can
                            be omitted.
        OS2_SHELL=exe       command processor to use for command shells. If this
                            is not specified, $(OS2_SHELL) is used, which is normally
                            specified in CONFIG.SYS. If that is not specified either,
                            ?:\OS2\CMD.EXE on the boot drive is used.

        Note that there is no way to specify the desktop directory through this file
        since the user's OS2.INI will rely on that.
