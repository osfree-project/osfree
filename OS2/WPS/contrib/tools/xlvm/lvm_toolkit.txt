=============================
Welcome to the LVM toolkit !
=============================

This toolkit is to be used to write applications or drivers
to interface with the eComStation LVM (logical volume manager).

Please note that the API's in LVM are very powerful. 
Its possible if not easy to trash your harddisk volumes and 
partitions with a few API calls. TAKE CARE !!

There are also API's to work with BootManager, including 
adding and removing BootManager from the hard disk !!
TAKE CARE !!


====The toolkit consists of the following files:================

lvm_intr.h		Main include file, use this as API 
			documentation until a read help file 
			is available.
lvm_cons.h		Included by lvm_intr.h
lvm_type.h		Included by lvm_intr.h
lvm_list.h		Included by lvm_intr.h
lvm_gbls.h		Included by lvm_intr.h
lvm.lib			LVM import library, must be specified 
			at link

lvm_toolkit.txt		This file

lvmtest.cpp		Example program that lists your volumes
lvmtest.cmd		Batch file to build lvmtest.exe


The library is built using IBM VisualAge C/C++ 3.6 and the lvmtest
uses that compiler. The header files seems to be quite generic but
if you are using another compiler there might be things that you
must modify to get it working.


====A few hints:=================================================

- Read through the lvm_intr.h to find out what can be done.
- All changes to drives/partitions/volumes must be comitted
  or changes will not be changed when you close your LVM 
  connection (Commit_Changes).
- You must use Open_LVM_Engine, Close_LVM_Engine to connect
  and disconnect from LVM.
- You must deallocate LVM allocated object when you do not 
  use it any more (Free_Engine_Memory)
- The 16 bit functions (for drivers) has NOT been tested.
- Some API's are specific to LVM2. The LVM included in 
  eComStation seems to be LVM1. 


====Limitations:=================================================

The LVM.DLL in eComStation is copyrighted work owned by 
IBM Corp. The LVM.LIB is probably also copyright IBM Corp.
However the included header files are part of the EVMS project
that is GNU open source. 
Where this leaves any application you write, 
I dont honestly know.



Good luck building LVM applications !
