Tools readme:

--  BuildLevel.cmd (C) Roman Stangl has been added with V0.9.0
    and is used to write build  level information into module
    definition files.
    See EDM/2 5/06 for details.

    Note: BuildLevel.cmd has been updated with V0.9.4 to support
    device driver DEF files. Please use the newest version.

--  copydbg.exe strips the debug code out of any executable (EXE
    or DLL) into a .DBG file with the same file stem. This is
    from the EXCEPT3 package available at hobbes. Source code is
    in tools\copydebug.

--  strrpl.exe has been written by me. It is for fast string search and
    replace in files and useful for updating the INF HTML sources to
    V0.83. This has been updated and bugfixed with V0.9.0.
    Start the program to have it explain itself.

    V0.9.16: strrpl has been moved to the xwphelpers main directory.
    The sources for strrpl are in the warpin repository in the tools
    directory.

--  unlock.exe is used by the XFolder makefiles to unlock the XFolder
    DLL currently locked by the WPS. This is taken from an old version
    of the lxLite package.
    This has been written by Andrew Pavel Zabolotny.
