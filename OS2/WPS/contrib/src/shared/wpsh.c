 *@@sourcefile wpsh.c:
 *      this file contains SOM and WPS helper functions.
 *
 *      Usage: All WPS classes.
 *
 *      The functions in this file fall into several
 *      categories:
 *
 *      --  Helper functions for messing with SOM method
 *          resolution. See wpshResolveFor and others.
 *
 *      --  Miscellaneous Desktop object helpers. See
 *          wpshCheckObject and others.
 *
 *      --  Miscellaneous object view helpers. See
 *          wpshCloseAllViews, wpshQuerySourceObject, and
 *          others.
 *
 *      --  Wrappers to call some important WPS methods
 *          that were not made public by IBM. See
 *          fdrRequestFolderMutexSem and others.
 *
 *      This file started out with V0.84 as "xwps.c". Most of
 *      these functions used to have the cmn* prefix and were
 *      spread across all over the .C source files, which
 *      was not very lucid. As a result, I have put these
 *      together in a separate file.
 *
 *      The code has been made independent of XWorkplace with V0.9.0,
 *      moved to the shared\ directory, and renamed to "wpsh.c".
 *
 *      All the functions in this file have the wpsh* prefix (changed
 *      with V0.9.0).

 *@@ wpshResolveFor:
 *      this resolves a method pointer as implemented by
 *      pClass. If pClass is NULL, the class of somSelf
 *      is used for resolving that method (which leads to
 *      somGetClass(somSelf) internally).
 *
 *      Returns NULL if the method could not be resolved.
 *
 *      "Resolving" means finding the address of a function
 *      as implemented for an object by a certain class.
 *      To call a method with manual resolve, you must first
 *      resolve the method name into a function address and
 *      then call that function indirectly.
 *
 *      This helper is especially useful in the following
 *      situations:
 *
 *      --  You want to call a method, but you don't have
 *          a C binding for it -- either because you don't
 *          want to include the header which defines it,
 *          or you don't have that header in the first
 *          place (e.g. because it's an undocumented WPS
 *          method).
 *
 *          In that case, specify pClass to NULL. This
 *          will have this function find the class object
 *          for somSelf's class itself.
 *
 *      --  You must explicitly resolve a method pointer
 *          for a parent class because you have introduced
 *          a method which is really an override, but there's
 *          no C binding for the parent call. See the example
 *          below.
 *
 *      --  You have manually patched a SOM method table
 *          using _somOverrideSMethod to override a static
 *          WPS method which is undocumented.
 *
 *      Remarks:
 *
 *      1.  This returns a PVOID. You must manually cast
 *          the return pointer to a function prototype
 *          pointer.
 *
 *          For documented WPS methods, you will find that
 *          the SOM header files prototype all functions as
 *
 +              somTD_Classname_Methodname,
 *
 *          e.g. somTD_XFldObject_xwpQuerySetup for xwpQuerySetup
 *          as implemented by XFldObject.
 *
 *          For some other methods, you will find prototypes
 *          in wpsh.h.
 *
 *      2.  Do not pass the underscore with the method name.
 *
 *      3.  This can return NULL for a number of reasons,
 *          e.g. the parent class was not found, or no parent
 *          class implements such a method. Make sure you
 *          spell the method name right.
 *
 *      4.  This works for instance and class methods. To
 *          resolve a class method, specify the class object
 *          with somSelf and set pClass to NULL. This will
 *          then find the class object for the class object...
 *          yes, such a thing exists. The metaclass of a
 *          metaclass is SOMClass (grin). What infinite wisdom
 *          in SOM there.
 *
 *      Example: Assume this class hierarchy:
 *
 +      WPObject
 +        +-- XFldObject
 +              +-- WPFileSystem
 +                    +-- WPFolder
 +                          +-- XFolder
 +                                +-- DemoFolder
 *
 *      Let's say that both XFldObject and DemoFolder introduce
 *      the "wpDemo" method. From DemoFolder, you want to call
 *      the parent implementation (which will lead to XFldObject's
 *      implementation). So do this:
 *
 +          DEMO_TYPEDEF pDemo = wpshResolveFor(somSelf,
 +                                              _XFldObject,
 +                                              "wpDemo");
 +
 +          if (pDemo)      // points to XFldObject::pDemo now
 +              pDemo(somSelf, ...);

/*
 *@@ wpshOverrideStaticMethod:
 *      this function manually patches a class's method
 *      table to override a method at runtime.
 *
 *      This is a wrapper around SOMClass::somOverrideSMethod,
 *      which is half-documented in somcls.idl in the toolkit
 *      headers. There we find:
 *
 *          "This method can be used instead of somAddStaticMethod or
 *          somAddDynamicMethod when it is known that the class'
 *          parent class already supports this method.  This call
 *          does not require the method descriptor and stub methods
 *          that the others do."
 *
 *      If you don't understand what this means... I don't
 *      either. I just tested whether this method can be used
 *      to hack a class's method table at runtime, and it
 *      worked.
 *
 *      Even though SOMREF says that use of that method is
 *      deprecated, it still works from my testing. Since
 *      SOM is never going to change any more (because IBM
 *      has stopped development), I think we can safely use
 *      this.
 *
 *      Now, this function is especially useful if you want
 *      to
 *
 *      --  override a method which only exists on Warp 4.
 *          It is an XWorkplace development policy that
 *          XWorkplace should compile with the Warp 3
 *          toolkit headers, so we can't override those
 *          methods directly.
 *
 *      --  override an undocumented WPS method.
 *
 *      To override such a method, pass in the class object
 *      (e.g. _XFldDataFile if you want to override a
 *      method for instances of XFldDataFile), the method
 *      name (without the underscore), and the address
 *      of the function which implements the override.
 *
 *      However, great care must be taken if you patch the
 *      method tables manually, most notably:
 *
 *      --  The method must exist in a parent class of
 *          somSelf. You can't add a new method this way.
 *
 *      --  The method must be a static SOM method. As
 *          far as I know, this is the case for all WPS
 *          methods (the WPS doesn't use dynamic methods).
 *
 *      --  Only patch the method tables when the class
 *          is initialized (best in the class's wpclsInitData).
 *          If you do it later, you're asking for problems.
 *
 *      --  Check the class object for whether it's really
 *          the class object you want... and not that of
 *          a descendant class. Descendant classes will
 *          inherit your method override anyway (tested).
 *
 *      --  The function passed in here must have the
 *          _System calling convention.
 *
 *      --  The function must have EXACTLY the same
 *          arguments as the method you override. SOM
 *          passes the arguments on the stack, and if
 *          they don't match -- boom.
 *
 *      --  You have no C binding for calling the parent
 *          method that you overrode. Use wpshParentNumResolve
 *          to resolve the parent function, which you then
 *          can call.
 *
 *      --  Presently, this has only been tested for
 *          overriding instance methods.
 *
 *      If you don't follow these rules, you get crashes.
 *      Period. So this isn't exactly trivial, but it works.
 *      XWorkplace uses this in M_XFldDataFile::wpclsInitData
 *      to patch in XFldDataFile::wpModifyMenu, for example.

 *      Since somIsObj doesn't seem to be working right,
 *      here is a new function which checks if pObject
 *      points to a valid Desktop object. This is done by
 *      temporarily installing yet another xcpt handler,
 *      so if the object ain't valid, calling this function
 *      doesn't crash, but returns FALSE only.
 *
 *      Even though the SOM reference says that somIsObj
 *      should be "failsafe", it is not. I've read somewhere
 *      that that function only checks if the object pointer
 *      points to something that looks like a method table,
 *      which doesn't look very failsafe to me, so use this
 *      one instead.
 *
 *      Note: this should not be called very often,
 *      because a SOM method is called upon the given
 *      object, which takes a little bit of time. Also, if
 *      the object is not valid, an exception is generated
 *      internally.
 *
 *      So call this only if you're unsure whether an object
 *      is valid.

 *@@ wpshQuerySourceObject:
 *      this helper function evaluates a given container
 *      to find out which objects have been selected while
 *      a context menu is open. The WPS gives the items on
 *      which the menu action should be performed upon
 *      container "source" emphasis, so this is what we
 *      evaluate.
 *
 *      This is used from XWorkplace to collect objects from
 *      a folder container when an operation is to be
 *      executed and the typical WPS behavior must be imitated.
 *      There are no WPS methods for this. By contrast, the
 *      WPS normally instead calls wpMenuItemSelected for every
 *      single selected object, which is not optimal in many
 *      cases.
 *
 *      This function only works when a context menu is open,
 *      because otherwise WPS cnr items don't have source emphasis.
 *
 *      However, if (fKeyboardMode == TRUE), this function
 *      does not check for source emphasis, but selection
 *      emphasis instead. Only in that case this function
 *      can be used even when no context menu is open on
 *      the container. This is useful for processing hotkeys
 *      on objects, because the WPS makes those work on
 *      selected objects only.
 *
 *      The result of this evaluation is stored in
 *      *pulSelection, which can be:
 *
 *      --   SEL_WHITESPACE the context menu was opened on the
 *                          whitespace of the container;
 *                          this func then returns the folder itself.
 *                          This is only possible if (fKeyboard ==
 *                          FALSE) because keyboard operations
 *                          never affect the currently open folder.
 *
 *      --   SEL_SINGLESEL  the context menu was opened for a
 *                          single selected object (that is,
 *                          exactly one object is selected and
 *                          the menu was opened above that object):
 *                          this func then returns that object.
 *
 *      --   SEL_MULTISEL   the context menu was opened on one
 *                          of a multitude of selected objects;
 *                          this func then returns the first of the
 *                          selected objects. Only in that case,
 *                          keep calling wpshQueryNextSourceObject
 *                          to get the other selected objects.
 *
 *      --   SEL_SINGLEOTHER the context menu was opened for a
 *                          single object _other_ than the selected
 *                          objects:
 *                          this func then returns that object.
 *                          This is only possible if (fKeyboard ==
 *                          FALSE).
 *
 *      --   SEL_NONEATALL: no object is selected. This is only
 *                          possible if (fKeyboard == TRUE); only
 *                          in that case, NULL is returned also.
 *
 *      Note that these flags are defined in include\helpers\cnrh.h,
 *      which should be included.
 *
 *      Keep in mind that if this function returns something other
 *      than the folder of the container (SEL_WHITESPACE), the
 *      returned object might be a shadow, which you might need to
 *      dereference before working on it.

 *      *phObject will be set to the object handle. Otherwise
 *      it will always be set to NULLHANDLE.
