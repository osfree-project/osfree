src\classes\ has the actual SOM classes code. The source files
were initially created by the SOM compiler from the IDL files
in idl\ and then filled with meaningful code.

All this code goes into XFLDR.DLL.

Note that most of the code in the files in this directory
only is "pure" method code which calls implementation code
in other directories. For example, xfldr.c (for the XFolder
class) calls code in src\filesys\folder.c and other files,
which then does the actual work. This way it's easier for
several developers to work on the same SOM classes.

include\classes\ is initially empty and receives the .h and
.ih files generated by the SOM compiler. These can always
be deleted and will be re-gerenerated.
