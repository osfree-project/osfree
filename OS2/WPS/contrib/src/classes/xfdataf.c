 *@@sourcefile xfdataf.c:
 *      This file contains SOM code for the following XWorkplace classes:
 *
 *      --  XFldDataFile (WPDataFile replacement)
 *
 *      XFldDataFile is responsible for menu manipulation
 *      and default icon replacements for data files.
 *      Since we should not override WPFileSystem to implement
 *      this functionality for folders and data files altogether,
 *      we must add this to WPDataFile separately.
 *
 *      Installation of this class is now optional (V0.9.0).
 *
 *      Starting with V0.9.0, the files in classes\ contain only
 *      i.e. the methods themselves.
 *      The implementation for this class is mostly in filesys\filesys.c
 *      and (for extended file types) in filesys\filetype.c.
 *
 *      <B>Extended File Associations</B>
 *
 *      -- To get the new associated programs into the "Open" menu,
 *         we override wpDisplayMenu (Warp 3) and wpModifyMenu
 *         (Warp 4).
 *
 *      -- For general WPS support (including icons), we override
 *         XFldDataFile::wpQueryAssociatedProgram.
 *
 *      -- The new selections are intercepted in XFldDataFile::wpOpen.

 *      in that it is called asynchronously on a background
 *      thread to defer thumbnail loading. However, there
 *      are differences:
 *
 *      --  This method actually gets called from the
 *          XFldDataFile::xwpLazyLoadIcon override and is
 *          thus specific to data files. In other words,
 *          only data files can ever have thumbnails.
 *
 *      --  It must create the bitmap with the given width
 *          and height, which are the current settings for
 *          folder thumbnails. If those are changed by the
 *          user, this method must get called again.
 *
 *      --  The caller takes care of repainting the object,
 *          which is different from XFldObject::xwpLazyLoadIcon,
 *          where the method must invalidate itself.
 *
 *      If this returns NULLHANDLE, this means that the
 *      method could not understand the file's format, and
 *      regular lazy icon processing takes place, i.e. the
 *      object will then receive an icon according to the
 *      usual data file rules. It will only get called
 *      again on explicit refresh.
 *
 *      The XFldDataFile base implementation calls
 *      _wpQueryBitmapHandle for instances of WPImageFile
 *      only and will return NULLHANDLE otherwise.

/*
 *@@ wpQueryIcon:
 *      this WPObject instance method returns the HPOINTER
 *      with the current icon of the object. For some WPS
 *      classes, icon loading is deferred until the first
 *      call to this method.
 *      See icons.c for an introduction.
 *
 *      With data files and all subclasses, this turns out
 *      to be a major mess. When being made awake, all
 *      data files initially receive a NULLHANDLE pointer.
 *      In WPDataFile::wpRestoreState, the WPS checks if
 *      the file-system data has an .ICON EA so this can
 *      be quickly set.
 *      Only in that case will the icon already be set
 *      when wpQueryIcon is called for the first time.
 *
 *      So I guess what is done here is the following:
 *
 *      --  If the icon has already been set (either in
 *          wpRestoreState or by a previous call to
 *          wpQueryIcon), return it.
 *
 *      --  If not, call wpSetIcon with the return value
 *          from wpQueryAssociatedProgram or, if no association
 *          exists, from wpclsQueryIcon of the file's class.
 *          Then return that new icon.
 *
 *          With V0.9.20, lazy icon loading was introduced.
 *          If enabled, in this case, we pass the object to
 *          the "lazy icons" thread to defer icon loading and
 *          only set a temporary default icon here.
 *
 *      Unfortunately the WPS always sets OBJSTYLE_NOTDEFAULTICON
 *      in here, which is not a good idea with our replacement
 *      associations.
 *
 *      Remarks for WPProgramFile:
 *
 *      --  WPProgramFile apparently overrides this method
 *          to call wpSetProgIcon directly. It also overrides
 *          wpSetAssociatedFileIcon to call wpSetProgIcon.
 *
 *      --  We thus "only" have to override XWPProgramFile::wpSetProgIcon
 *          to replace the executable icons. However, with V0.9.20
 *          we override XWPProgramFile::wpQueryIcon also to
 *          support lazy icons there too.
 *
 *      --  Since WPCommandFile is derived from WPProgramFile,
 *          this affects command files as well.
 *
 *      What a mess.

 *@@ wpQueryAssociatedProgram:
 *      this method returns the associated WPProgram or
 *      WPProgramFile object for the specified view ID of
 *      a data file.
 *
 *      The WPS docs say that this should be overridden
 *      to introduce new association mechanisms.
 *
 *      Yeah, right. Per default, this gets called from
 *      XFldDataFile::wpQueryAssociatedFileIcon -- that
 *      is, only while a folder is being populated, but
 *      _not_ when a context menu is opened. There seems
 *      to be a second association mechanism in wpModifyPopupMenu
 *      somewhere to add all the associated programs to
 *      the "Open" submenu. I have tested this by returning
 *      NULL in this method, and all the program objects
 *      still appear in the "Open" menu -- it's just the
 *      data file icons which get set to the default icon
 *      then.
 *
 *      Soooo... to give the data files new icons, we need
 *      to override this method since it gets called from
 *      wpQueryAssociatedFileIcon (which normally gets called
 *      during folder populate).
 *
 *      See XFldDataFile::wpQueryIcon for an introduction
 *      to the data file icon mess.
 *
 *      From what I see, ulView is normally 0x1000, which
 *      is the WPS-internal code for the first associated
 *      program. This is only > 1000 if the default
 *      association has been changed on the "Menu" page
 *      of a data file (1001 for the second assoc, 1002
 *      for the third, etc.).
 *
 *      However, this also needs to support OPEN_RUNNING
 *      and OPEN_DEFAULT.
 *
 *      This returns NULL if there's no associated program
 *      for the specified view. Otherwise it returns a
 *      WPProgram or WPProgramFile, which has been locked
 *      once.
 *
 *      The caller should unlock the object after it's
 *      done using it. AFAIK, WPS wpQueryAssociatedFileIcon
 *      does this.

 *
 *      With V1.0.0, while adding support for the split view
 *      to the menu methods, I finally got tired of all the
 *      send-msg hacks to get Warp 4 menu items to work and
 *      decided to finally break Warp 3 support for XWorkplace.
 *      It's been fun while it lasted, but enough is enough.
 *      We are now overriding this method directly through
 *      the IDL files.
 *
 *      ulMenuType will be one of the following:
 *
 *      --  MENU_OBJECTPOPUP: Pop-up menu for the object icon.
 *          This can come in for any object.
 *
 *      --  MENU_OPENVIEWPOPUP: Pop-up menu for an open view.
 *          I think this can reasonably only come in for folders,
 *          although it seems to be handled by the WPObject method.
 *
 *      --  MENU_FOLDERPULLDOWN: Pull-down menu for a folder.
 *          This comes in for folders only.
 *
 *      --  MENU_EDITPULLDOWN: Pull-down menu for the Edit menu option.
 *          This comes in TWICE, first on the selected object in
 *          the view's container (if any) with ulView == CLOSED_ICON,
 *          and then a second time on the view's folder with ulView
 *          set to the folder's current view.
 *
 *      --  MENU_VIEWPULLDOWN: Pull-down menu for the View menu option.
 *          This comes in for folders only.
 *
 *      --  MENU_SELECTEDPULLDOWN: Pull-down menu for the Selected menu option.
 *          This comes in for non-folder objects also to let the object
 *          decide what options it wants to present in the folder's
 *          "Selected" pulldown.
 *
 *      --  MENU_HELPPULLDOWN: Pull-down menu for the Help menu option.
 *          This comes in for folders only.
 *
 *      --  MENU_TITLEBARPULLDOWN: this is listed in the toolkit headers,
 *          but not described in WPSREF. I think this is what comes in
 *          if the system menu is being built for an open object view.

 *@@ wpOpen:

 *      gets called after wpViewObject has scanned the

 *      view is needed.
 *
 *      This _normally_ runs on thread 1 of the WPS, but
 *      this is not always the case. If this gets called
 *      in response to a menu selection from the "Open"
 *      submenu or a double-click in the folder, this runs
 *      on the thread of the folder (which _normally_ is
 *      thread 1). However, if this results from WinOpenObject
 *      or an OPEN setup string, this will not be on thread 1.
 *
 *      Of course, for data files, the "views" are the
 *      various associations in the "Open" submenu, which
 *      have ulView IDs >= 0x1000. If the default view
 *      has been manually set for the object, wpOpen
 *      always receives this ID.
 *
 *      By contrast, we can also get OPEN_RUNNING or
 *      OPEN_DEFAULT. I think OPEN_RUNNING comes in
 *      for "standard" data files which have been
 *      double-clicked on.
 *
 *      There are two more problems with starting the
 *      associated program (damn it, IBM, do you ever
 *      read the specs that you've written yourself?):
 *
 *      --  The WPS always uses its internal list of
 *          associations, no matter what we return from
 *          XFldDataFile::wpQueryAssociatedProgram, so
 *          we need to override this method as well and
 *          intercept the new menu items that we have changed.
 *
 *      --  We cannot use the WPProgram/WPProgramFile classes
 *          to start the associated programs. These things do
 *          not accept parameters, and of course there's no
 *          export for resolving all the parameter placeholders.
 *          So we need to start the program ourselves with
 *          the data file as the parameter, using progOpenProgram.

 *@@ wpSetTitleAndRenameFile:
 *      this WPFileSystem method is responsible for setting
 *      the real name _and_ the title of a file-system object.
 *
 *      WPFileSystem::wpSetTitle only calls this method and
 *      does nothing else. In other words, this method is
 *      the implementation for WPFileSystem::wpSetTitle;
 *      fConfirmations is then set to what _wpQueryConfirmations
 *      returns.
 *
 *      Now, here is the code flow when data files get renamed
 *      in the WPS (without XWorkplace):
 *
 *      1)  wpSetTitle is overridden by WPFileSystem to call
 *          WPFileSystem::wpSetTitleAndRenameFile instead.
 *
 *      2)  WPFileSystem::wpSetTitleAndRenameFile goes thru
 *          a lot of hoops to verify the title and handle
 *          file system conflicts, but eventually calls
 *          wpSetRealName and then its parent's wpSetTitle:
 *
 *          a)  wpSetRealName is overridden by WPDataFile,
 *              which calls the parent (WPDataFile::wpSetRealName)
 *              to actually rename the file and then update
 *              the file's associations.
 *
 *          b)  The parent wpSetTitle is WPObject's, which
 *              refreshes MINIRECORDCORE.pszIcon and updates
 *              the object in all containers.
 *
 *      One permanent bug with this has been that
 *      WPDataFile::wpSetRealname (2-a above) calls
 *      wpSetAssociatedFileIcon to update the icon in case the
 *      assoc has changed. Great idea, but the assoc is
 *      determined according to the title, which is only changed
 *      afterwards (2-b above). So this appears to be the reason
 *      why this has never worked in the WPS.
 *
 *      To fix this, we do the following:
 *
 *      --  override XFldDataFile::wpSetRealName to _not_ call
 *          the WPDataFile implementation, by calling our new
 *          XWPFileSystem::wpSetRealNameNoOverride method,
 *          which ends up in the correct XWPFileSystem::wpSetRealName
 *          (without updating the associated file icon);
 *
 *      --  override XFldDataFile::wpSetTitleAndRenameFile
 *          (this method here) to update the associated file
 *          icon _after_ the title has successfully changed.
