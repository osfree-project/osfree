 *@@sourcefile xwphook.c:
 *      this has the all the code for XWPHOOK.DLL, which implements
 *      all the XWorkplace PM system hooks, as well as a few exported
 *      interface functions which may only be called by the XWorkplace
 *      daemon process (XWPDAEMN.EXE).
 *
 *      There are four hooks at present:
 *
 *      --  hookSendMsgHook
 *
 *      --  hookLockupHook
 *
 *      --  hookInputHook
 *
 *      --  hookPreAccelHook
 *
 *      See the remarks in the respective functions.
 *
 *      I have tried to design the hooks for clarity and lucidity with
 *      respect to interfaces and configuration --
 *      as if that was possible with system hooks at all, since they
 *      are so messy by nature.
 *
 *      With V0.9.12, the hook code was spread across several files
 *
 *      1)  to group the actual hook functions together for a better
 *          code path,
 *
 *      2)  to make all this more readable.
 *
 *      A couple words of wisdom about the hook code:
 *
 *      --  System hooks are possibly running in the context of each PM
 *          thread which is processing a message -- that is, possibly each
 *          thread on the system which has created a message queue.
 *
 *          As a result, great care must be taken when accessing global
 *          data, and one must keep in mind for each function which thread
 *          it might run in, or otherwise we'd be asking for system hangs.
 *          Don't expect OS/2 to handle exceptions properly if all PM
 *          programs crash at the same time.
 *
 *          It _is_ possible to access static global variables of
 *          this DLL from every function, because the DLL is
 *          linked with the STATIC SHARED flags (see xwphook.def).
 *          This means that the single data segment of the DLL
 *          becomes part of each process which is using the DLL
 *          (that is, each PM process on the system). We use this
 *          for the HOOKDATA structure, which is a static global
 *          structure in the DLL's shared data segment and is
 *          returned to the daemon when it calls hookInit in the DLL.
 *
 *          HOOKDATA includes a HOOKCONFIG structure. As a result,
 *          to configure the basic hook flags, the daemon can simply
 *          modify the fields in the HOOKDATA structure to configure
 *          the hook's behavior.
 *
 *          It is however _not_ possible to use malloc() to allocate
 *          global memory and use it between several calls of the
 *          hooks, because that memory will belong to one process
 *          only, even if the pointer is stored in a global DLL
 *          variable. The next time the hook gets called and accesses
 *          that memory, some fairly random application will crash
 *          (the one the hook is currently called for), or the system
 *          will hang completely.
 *
 *          For this reason, the hooks use another block of shared
 *          memory internally, which is protected by a named mutex
 *          semaphore, for storing the list of object hotkeys (which
 *          is variable in size). This block is (re)allocated in
 *          hookSetGlobalHotkeys and requested in the hook when
 *          WM_CHAR comes in. The mutex is necessary because when
 *          hotkeys are changed, the daemon changes the structure by
 *          calling hookSetGlobalHotkeys.
 *
 *      --  The exported hook* functions may only be used by one
 *          single process. It is not possible for one process to
 *          call hookInit and for another to call another hook*
 *          function, because the shared memory which is allocated
 *          here must be "owned" by a certain process and would not be
 *          properly freed if several processes called the hook
 *          interfaces.
 *
 *          So, per definition, it is only the XWorkplace daemon's
 *          (XWPDAEMN.EXE) responsibility to interface and configure
 *          the hook. Theoretically, we could have done this from
 *          XFLDR.DLL in PMSHELL.EXE also, but using the daemon has a
 *          number of advantages to that, since it can be terminated
 *          and restarted independently of the WPS (see xwpdaemn.c
 *          for details). Also, if something goes wrong, it's only
 *          the daemon which crashes, and not the entire WPS.
 *
 *          When any configuration data changes which is of importance
 *          to the hook, XFLDR.DLL writes this data to OS2.INI and
 *          then posts the daemon a message. The daemon then reads
 *          the new data and notifies the hook thru defined interface
 *          functions. All configuration structures are declared in
 *          xwphook.h.

 *      are freed and reallocated. Access to those blocks
 *      is protected by a mutex semaphore internally in case
 *      WM_CHAR comes in while the lists are being modified,
 *      which will cause the hook functions to be running

 *      This hook gets called just before the system returns
 *      from a WinGetMsg or WinPeekMsg call. As a result, this
 *      does _not_ get called on the poster's thread (who called
 *      WinPostMsg), but on the receiver's thread.
 *
 *      However, only _posted_ messages go thru this hook. _Sent_
 *      messages never get here; there is a separate hook type
 *      for that (see hookSendMsgHook).
 *
 *      This implements the XWorkplace mouse features such as
 *      hot corners, sliding focus, mouse-button-3 scrolling etc.
 *
 *      Note: WM_CHAR messages (hotkeys) are not processed here,
 *      but rather in hookPreAccelHook, which gets called even
 *      before this hook. See remarks there.
 *
 *      We return TRUE if the message is to be swallowed, or FALSE
 *      if the current application (or the next hook in the hook
 *      chain) should still receive the message.
 *
 *      I have tried to keep the actual hook function as short as
 *      possible. Several separate subfunctions have been extracted
 *      which only get called if the respective functionality is
 *      actually needed (depending on the message and whether the
 *      respective feature has been enabled), both for clarity and
 *      speed. This is faster because the hook function gets called
 *      thousands of times (for every posted message...), and this
 *      way it is more likely that the hook code can completely remain
 *      in the processor caches all the time when lots of messages are
 *      processed.

 *@@ hookPreAccelHook:
 *      this is the pre-accelerator-table hook. Like
 *      hookInputHook, this gets called when messages
 *      are coming in from the system input queue, but
 *      as opposed to a "regular" input hook, this hook
 *      gets called even before translation from accelerator
 *      tables occurs.
 *
 *      Pre-accel hooks are not documented in the PM Reference.
 *      I have found this idea (and part of the implementation)
 *      in the source code of ProgramCommander/2, so thanks
 *      go out (once again) to Roman Stangl.
 *
 *      In this hook, we check for the global object hotkeys
 *      so that we can use certain key combinations regardless
 *      of whether they might be currently used in application
 *      accelerator tables. This is especially useful for
 *      "Alt" key combinations, which are usually intercepted
 *      when menus have corresponding shortcuts.
 *
 *      As a result, as opposed to other hotkey software you
 *      might know, XWorkplace does properly react to "Ctrl+Alt"
 *      keyboard combinations, even if a menu would get called
 *      with the "Alt" key. ;-)
 *
 *      As with hookInputHook, we return TRUE if the message is
 *      to be swallowed, or FALSE if the current application (or
 *      the next hook in the hook chain) should still receive the
 *      message.
