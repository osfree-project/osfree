 *@@ WMMouseMove_SlidingFocus:
 *      this gets called when hookInputHook intercepts
 *      WM_MOUSEMOVE to do the "sliding focus" processing.
 *
 *      This function evaluates hwnd to find out whether
 *      the mouse has moved over a new frame window.
 *      If so, XDM_SLIDINGFOCUS is posted to the daemon's
 *      object window, which will then do the actual focus
 *      and active window processing (starting a timer, if
 *      delayed focus is active).
 *
 *      Processing is fairly complicated because special
 *      case checks are needed for certain window classes
 *      (combo boxes, Win-OS/2 windows). Basically, this
 *      function finds the frame window to which hwnd
 *      (the window under the mouse, from the hook) belongs
 *      and passes that frame to the daemon. If another
 *      frame is found between the main frame and hwnd,
 *      that frame is passed to the daemon also.
 *
 *      Frame activation is then not done from the hook, but
 *      from the daemon instead.
 *
 *      Inspired by code from ProgramCommander (W) Roman Stangl.

/*
 *@@ WMMouseMove_SlidingMenus:
 *      this gets called when hookInputHook intercepts
 *      WM_MOUSEMOVE and the window under the mouse is
 *      a menu control to do automatic menu selection.
 *
 *      This implementation is slightly tricky. ;-)
 *      We cannot query the MENUITEM data of a menu
 *      which does not belong to the calling process
 *      because this message needs access to the caller's
 *      storage. I have tried this, this causes every
 *      application to crash as soon as a menu item
 *      gets selected.
 *
 *      Fortunately, Roman Stangl has found a cool way
 *      of doing this, so I could build on that.
 *
 *      So now we start a timer in the daemon which will
 *      post a special WM_MOUSEMOVE message back to us
 *      which can only be received by us
 *      (with the same HWND and MP1 as the original
 *      WM_MOUSEMOVE, but a special flag in MP2). When
 *      that special message comes in, we can select
 *      the menu item.
 *
 *      In addition to Roman's code, we always change the
 *      MIA_HILITE attribute of the current menu item
 *      under the mouse, so the menu hilite follows the
 *      mouse immediately, even though submenus may be
 *      opened delayed.
 *
 *      We return TRUE if the msg is to be swallowed.
 *
 *      Inspired by code from ProgramCommander (W) Roman Stangl.
