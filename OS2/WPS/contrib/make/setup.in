# the TDF file will be copied to $(XWPRUNNING)\bin (where XFLDR.DLL
# is also copied to).
#
# Note: This has only been tested with the most recent enhancements
# to the trace facility (Warp 4 FP 10 or later). Comment out the
# following statement if you run into trouble. Also, this takes
# quite a bit of time at compile time and slows down execution also.

# PRECOMPILED HEADERS
# -------------------

# The following is the directory for precompiled header files.
# This is a feature of VAC++ 3.0 to speed up compilation.
#
# If the PRECH variable is defined (which should point to a
# valid directory), precompiled headers will automatically be
# enabled for all compilations. This dramatically speeds up
# repetitive compilations (up to three times, especially with
# the extremely complex SOM header files).
#
# If the PRECH variable is not defined, precompiled header files
# will not be used. Uncomment the below statement if you have
# trouble. This will work fine, but slower.
#
# I strongly recommend using a RAM disk for this. This makes sure
# that the prech's won't use space on your disks forever.
# I use RAMFS.IFS for the RAM disk, which is much more reliable
# than OS/2's VDISK.SYS.
# I have TEMP set to "R:\temp", which I create at each bootup
# from CONFIG.SYS. VAC++ and the SOM compiler crash when specifying
# a root directory (e.g. "R:\") as a temp/prech directory.
#
# Note that we create a _separate_ precompiled header file for each
# source file (in the $(PRECH) directory). This eats up a lot
# of space (I have about 70 MB after a complete XWorkplace build!!),
# but makes sure that the precompiled header does not get recreated
# for each source file, which is a lot faster.
#
# So be warned: if you have TEMP on a RAM disk, this better be
# able to hold more than 30 MBs. If you're using a RAM disk, you
# should have 128 MBs of RAM on your system, or otherwise you'll
# only hear the swap file rattle.
#
# Here are compile times for "nmake -a compile" on the main makefile
# (PII-400, 128 MB RAM, using RAMFS.IFS, code of 99-10-22):
# -- without PRECH:     2:01 minutes
# -- with PRECH:        1:08 minutes
#
# Decide for yourself. ;-)

# /g3|4|5: optimize for 386/486/Pentium                 [/g3]

# /ge-: create DLL code                                 [/ge+]
#           This switches between EXE and DLL initialization code
#           for the .OBJ file. /ge+ is only needed when the object
#           file contains a main() function. For libraries to be
#           used either with EXE's or DLL's, use /ge+.
# /gh+: generate profiling hooks for VAC profiler
# /gi+: fast integer execution
# /Gl+: remove unreferenced functions (when comp.+link in 1 step)
# /gm+: multithread libraries
# /gm+: disable stack probes (single-thread only!)
# /kc+: produce preprocessor warnings
# /o+:  optimization (inlining etc.)
# /oi-: no inlining (?)
# /ol+: use intermediate linker; do _not_ use with debug code
# /q+:  suppress icc logo
# /Re : don't use subsystem libraries (!= Rn)
# /se:  all language extensions
# /si+: allow use of precompiled header files
# /ss:  allow double slashes comments in C too
# /ti+: debug code
# /tdp: compile everything as C++, even if it has a .C suffix
# /tm:  use debug memory management (malloc etc.)
# /tn:  add source line numbers to object files (for mapfile); a subset of /ti+
# /Wcls: class problems
# /Wcnd: conditional exprs problems (= / == etc.)
# /Wcmp: possible unsigned comparison redundancies
# /Wcns: operations involving constants
# /Wcnv: conversions
# /Wcpy: copy constructor problems
# /Weff: statements with no effect (annoying)
# /Wgen: generic debugging msgs
# /Wobs: obsolete features
# /Word: unspecified evaluation order
# /Wpar: list non-referenced parameters (annoying)
# /Wppc: list possible preprocessor problems (.h dependencies)
# /Wpro: warn if funcs have not been prototyped
# /Wrea: mark code that cannot be reached
# /Wret: check consistency of return levels
# /Wuni: uninitialized variables
# /Wuse: unused variables
