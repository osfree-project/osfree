<P>Are you too annoyed too by the fact that double-clicking on a URL or HTML
file on your hard disk will always start a new instance of
Netscape or Mozilla, even though it is already running? This is a waste of
time, memory, and system resources.

<P>The <B>Netscape DDE Interface</B> is the solution.
You can associate it with HTML and URL
files, so that when you double-click on them, your browser will either be
started or, if it's already running, the HTML file or URL
will simply be passed to the running instance.

<P>NetscapeDDE should work with all of Netscape 2.02, 4.04, and 4.61 for &os2;.

<P>It also works with Mozilla versions that have DDE support; this should at least
be the case for Mozilla versions 1.0.0 and above. See <a href="nsd_4tips.html">Tips &amp; Tricks</a>
for how to get this to work.
