<!-- This is all new with V0.9.7. -->
<BODY>
Starting with V0.9.7, &xwp; contains a replacement to &warp4;'s &warpcenter;.
This is called the "&xcenter;".

<P>Technically, this is not a &warpcenter; replacement... it does not replace the
"SmartCenter" WPS class, since that class is completely undocumented in the first place.
Instead, the &xcenter; is a new implementation from scratch. It is not compatible with
the &warpcenter; and does not take over its settings, but it can do pretty much the same...
and more.

<P>Compared to the &warpcenter;, the &xcenter; offers you the following advantages:

<UL><LI>It is <B>fully configurable.</B> You can add items to the &xcenter; at your free will,
while the &warpcenter; will always contain fixed items at fixed locations.

<P>The items in the &xcenter; are called "widgets". You can add widgets to the &xcenter;
in any order.

<P>See <A HREF="ctr_2addwgt.html">"Adding and removing widgets"</A> for details.

<P><LI>You can have <B>more than one &xcenter;</B> on your system. Each &xcenter; stores its
widgets and their settings separately so that they will never conflict.

<P><LI>The &xcenter; offers you <B>more display styles</B> than the &warpcenter;. You can drag
and drop fonts and colors onto the widgets, which will retain these settings
individually. Besides, the &xcenter; has an "auto-hide" option so that it will reduce
itself to a tiny bar at the bottom of the screen, similar to the task bar on
Windows 95. You can set those display options in the &xcenter;'s settings notebook.

<P><LI>The &xcenter; supports <B>plug-in DLLs.</B> Any programmer can add new widget types
to the &xcenter; by writing a DLL and put it into the <CODE>plugins\xcenter</CODE>
directory of the &xwp; installation directory.

<P>See <A HREF="ctr_9plugin.html">"About plug-in DLLs"</A> for details.

<P><LI>The &xcenter; runs on a <B>separate thread</B> within the WPS and can thus run with
a higher priority than other programs. You can set the priority in the &xcenter;'s
settings notebook.

<P>While this cannot fix the PM single input queue (SIQ) problems, this can still
give you access to the &xcenter; if some program uses up all CPU time.
