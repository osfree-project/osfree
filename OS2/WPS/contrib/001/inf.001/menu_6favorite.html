XFolder offers you to view the contents of folders from the context menus
without having to open them. This can be very handy if you need to open a single file
from a folder, but you do not want to open a dozen folders in order to reach it.
<P>Here's an example (the "XFolder" development directory from the author's harddisk):
<P><IMG SRC="favorite.gif">
<P>As you can see, the content of the "XFolder" folder is displayed; the subfolders in
this folders lead to subsequent submenus.
<P>The "Folder content" menus behave just like the &warpcenter;'s do: if you click on an item,
its default view will be opened. If you click on a folder menu item, another submenu with
the contents of this folder will be opened; if you click on it with mouse button 2,
the WPS folder will be opened as a window instead.
<P>The "Folder content" functions are used in two different contexts:
<UL><LI>For one, you can decide to always have the contents of the folder whose context
menu you have opened displayed in this very context menu. The respective context menu item
is then called "Folder contents" (how surprising). As a result, the "Folder contents" menu
is different for each context menu.
<P>In the above screenshot, this can be seen
with the "Ordnerinhalt" menu item (which is German for <STRONG>"Folder content";</STRONG>
sorry, I was just
too lazy to do a second screenshot).

<!-- this paragraph added with V0.81 -->
<P>The folder content menus can be switched on and off on the "Context menus" page
in the new
<A HREF="sys_2global.html">"Workplace Shell" object</A>.

<BR><LI>Second, you can declare a certain folder to be one of your <STRONG>"favorite" folders.</STRONG>
This can be done on the "View" page in every folder's Settings notebook.
All "favorite" folders will be displayed in all context menus; you can, for example, switch this
feature on for the Desktop, and you will be able to reach the Desktop and everything that
resides on and below its folder hierarchy from all context menus. (This works for the Drives
folder also, by the way.)
<P>In the above screenshot, the "frequent" menu item is a folder on my Desktop in which I put
things I access frequently. I have declared this folder to be my only "favorite" folder,
so everything I put in this folder will appear in all context menus.
