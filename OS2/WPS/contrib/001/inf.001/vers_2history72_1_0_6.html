<P>All the bugs below have been fixed by Paul Ratcliffe unless otherwise noted.

<P>Bugfixes:

<UL><LI>Fixed a trap in the daemon when deselecting the XWP Hook with Xcenter's Window List
widget active. Bug 748.

XCenter. Bug 792.

Holding down the Shift key allows windows to be positioned anywhere. This is the reverse
of the previous behaviour, at user request. Bug 733.

only partially applied in the previous version. Bug 760.

<P><LI>Fixed a bug with the XShutdown configuration dialog wouldn't switch back from ACPI
to APM shutdown. Bug 728.

<P><LI>Fixed a bug during initial installation of the XCenter where it wasn't adding the
"Desktop Lock", "Find Utility", and "Shutdown" objects. Bug 749.

<P><LI>The XCenter Tray selection bitmap was made bigger to match the other icons. Bug 729.

<P><LI>Fixed bugs with the DEFAULTOBJECT and OPEN setting strings being ignored with
XWPString objects. Bug 823.

<P><LI>Implemented folder setup string DEFAULTVIEW=SPLITVIEW. Fixed OPEN= setup string for
disk objects which was mostly completely unimplemented. Bug 827.

<P><LI>Stopped the Shredder Object from behaving like the Trash Can (except if Shift is
pressed). Bug 413.

<P><LI>The keyboard NumLock LED was not always set correctly when using the
"Enable NumLock on Startup" feature. Bug 831.

<P><LI>Printer and Transient objects are now prevented from being moved to the Trash Can.

<P><LI>Showing or maximizing a previously maximized and then minimized view of the WPS
Class List caused the window not to display properly. Also affected Folder Split Views.

being saved correctly. Bug 56.
