<!--- most of this file used to be fldr_32statusbars.html before V0.84.
      However, the different mnemonic descriptions have been moved to
      separate pages to make them easier to find.
      Except for the new WPUrl support, the codes have not changed. You
      can just copy your existing translations to the new files. -->
<!-- Changed with V0.9.0: see notes below -->
<BODY>
<!-- V0.9.0: add the following line -->
<B>Class: XFolder</B><HR>
<!-- the following paragraph updated with V0.84 -->
Page 2 of the "Status bars" pages in the
<A HREF="sys_2global.html">"Workplace Shell"</A> object
lets you determine in detail what information will be displayed in status bars.
<P>As explained in the <A HREF="stat_1intro.html">Status bar introduction,</A>
status bars display different information depending on whether no object,
exactly one object or several objects have been selected in a folder.
<P>For each of these modes you may define what exactly will be displayed.
XFolder uses certain (not very intuitive, however flexible) <B>codes</B> to
display folder information.
<P>It is
recommended to have both the status bar settings page and
a sample folder open while experimenting with these settings.
<P>All numeric output is formatted according to
your settings in the "Country" object in your System Setup
folder. That is, XFolder uses those settings to determine the thousands separator for
values greater than 1000 and the display format for date and time output.

<!-- V0.9.13: replaced all the following -->
<P>For a detailed list of all the supported status bar codes, press the
"Help" button on the second "Status bars" page in the "Workplace Shell" object.
