&xwp; is an open source project with a
<A HREF="notices_30team.html">development team</A>.

<P>The recommended way
to contact all developers (and possibly other users as well) is to use
the <B>&xwp; mailing lists</B>.

<P>To contact the developers, send a message to one of the
following addresses. You are also welcome to subscribe to any of these
lists if you're interested in &xwp;'s progress.

<UL><LI><CODE>xworkplace-user@netlabs.org</CODE> is for &xwp; users.
<!-- V1.0.1: changed the following -->
Use this address for public discussions about &xwp; if you don't understand
the source code. However, for bug reports, we kindly ask you to use the
bugtracker listed below.

<P><LI><CODE>xworkplace-dev@netlabs.org</CODE> is for messages related
to the source code. This is used by the developers to communicate and can
also be used by anyone else.

</UL>However, please read through the
<A HREF="070faq.html">"Frequently Asked Questions"</A>
section before contacting the developers; maybe you will already find
what you're looking for in there.

<!-- V1.0.1: added this -->
<P>To <b>report bugs,</b> the recommended way is to use the official
XWorkplace bugtracker at <a href="http://xtracker.netlabs.org">http://xtracker.netlabs.org</a>.
Create an account for yourself, and then you can file bugs.

<!-- V0.9.19: web address changed -->
<P><A HREF="http://www.xworkplace.org"><CODE>http://www.xworkplace.org</CODE></A>
is &xwp;'s home page on the World Wide Web. Watch this space for news,
updates, and public downloads.
<P>A <B>public bug list</B> is also maintained on that homepage.

<P><B>Reporting bugs.</B> Please include the following information (the more, the better):
<UL><LI>Please describe the situation in which the error occurred and whether it is
reproduceable.
<BR><LI>Include the <B>&os2; version</B> you are running
(Warp 3 or 4, MCP/ACP/1/2, eComStation, including the fixpak level).
<BR><LI>Include a list of <B>other PM or WPS enhancers</B> you are running.
<BR><LI>Look in the root directory of your boot drive for a file
named <CODE>XFLDTRAP.LOG</CODE>. This file logs &xwp;'s exceptions which
might have occurred on your system. If it exists, please include it in your message.

<!-- V0.9.19: added this paragraph -->
<BR><LI>If you are experiencing problems during WPS startup, enable the
<CODE>XWPSTART.LOG</CODE> file on the "Startup" page in the Desktop's settings
notebook (assuming that you can still get there).
This will create a file of the same name in the root directory of the boot drive
during WPS startup. Please include this file also.

<BR><LI>If you are running into problems with the eXtended Shutdown / Restart Desktop features,
please switch on the automatic log function on the "Shutdown" page of the Desktop's
settings notebook. This will create a file named <CODE>XSHUTDWN.LOG</CODE> in the same
location during shutdown. Please include this file also.
