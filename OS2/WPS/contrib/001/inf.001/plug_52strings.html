OK, so your minimal widget from step 1 is running.

<P>You probably have figured out already that even though the minimal widget does
react to fonts and colors dropped on it, those fonts and colors are not saved
when the &xcenter; is closed and then re-opened.

<P>Similarly, if you changed the minimal widget to be sizeable (by setting the
<CODE>WGTF_SIZEABLE</CODE> flag in the <CODE>ulClassFlags</CODE> field of
<A HREF="plug_9xcenterwidgetclass.html"><CODE>XCENTERWIDGETCLASS</CODE></A>,
you will find out that the widget's size will not be remembered either.

<P>Of course, the &xcenter; could have implemented saving these settings for your
widget. But then, where would your widget store additional data that the &xcenter;
would not know of? Using the profile functions to store the widget data in
<CODE>OS2.INI</CODE> would not be a good idea because there can be several
instances of your widget, which should all store their data independently.

<P>As a result, I figured that storing widgets data together with the data of
the &xcenter; that the widget belongs to would be the best idea.

<P>To make this most flexible and easy to use, the widgets can have <B>setup strings</B>
associated with them. If you look at the "Widgets" page in the properties notebook
of an &xcenter;, you will see
that each widget can have its own setup string to store any data it wants.

<P>Even though the widgets are not Desktop objects themselves, for simplicity, I chose
to use the WPS setup string format for the widgets also. That is, your widget
can understand, for example, a <CODE>BACKGROUNDCOLOR=00FF00;</CODE> setup string,
which would set the widget's background color to green.

<P>Your widget class must now implement two things:

<UL><LI><B>Parse a setup string</B> and convert it into binary data that your widget
can use. In the above example, for the background color, you could say that the
<CODE>BACKGROUNDCOLOR</CODE> string would have to be followed by a six-digit RGB
hex value. The definition is up to your widget class.

<P><LI><B>Create a setup string</B> from a set of binary values. This is needed when
the data of your widget is about to be saved.

</UL>When your widget is created, it receives a previously stored setup string
in the <CODE>pcszSetupString</CODE> field of its
<A HREF="plug_9xcenterwidget.html"><CODE>XCENTERWIDGET</CODE></A> structure that
comes with <CODE>WM_CREATE</CODE>. You can then allocate your own structure and
store it in <CODE>XCENTERWIDGET.pUser</CODE>, parse the setup string, and store
the values in there. Of course, you should set up safe defaults if a setup string
is missing because there won't be any when your widget is initially created by
the user.

<P>Reversely, when your widget's data has changed (e.g. because a new background
color has been dropped on it), it should compose a new full setup string.
<!-- V0.9.14: changed the following -->
After the new setup string is composed, the widget must send the
<CODE>XCM_SAVESETUP</CODE> message to its parent window (which is either the
&xcenter; client or a tray widget window, if the widget resides in a tray),
<!-- end V0.9.14 -->
which will cause the
new setup string to be stored together with the other widget data in the &xcenter;'s
private data. See <CODE>center.h</CODE> for details.

<P>In order to encapsulate the setup string functionality, I recommend that you
create a new structure definition for "saveable instance data". This could, for
example, contain fields for background, foreground color, and font to be used.
For sizeable widgets, this could also include the current size.

<P>This encapsulation allows your widget class to work on setup strings with setup
dialogs later also, which can even be invoked when no instance of your widget
presently exists.

<P>The minimal sample has no provisions for setup strings. Download the &xwp;
source code and look into the <CODE>src\widgets</CODE> directory, which has more
examples for how this works. <CODE>XFLDR.DLL</CODE> also exports a couple of
handy functions that you can use to parse setup strings more easily.
