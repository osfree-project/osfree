WPObject is the WPS base class for all objects. It is not used directly, but all
other WPS classes are derived from it. As a result, all Desktop objects (including
files, folders, and program objects) support the following setup strings:
<DL>
<DT><CODE><B>CCVIEW</B>=DEFAULT</CODE>
<DD>Uses the default value of the
concurrent view setting of the
system, when the user selects
open. This is the default
value.

<P><DT><CODE>CCVIEW=YES</CODE>
<DD>Creates new views of the
object every time the user
selects open.

<P><DT><CODE>CCVIEW=NO</CODE>
<DD>Resurfaces open views of
object, when the user selects
open.

<P><DT><CODE><B>HELPLIBRARY</B>=<I>filename</I></CODE>
<DD>Sets the help library.

<P><DT><CODE><B>HELPPANEL</B>=<I>id</I></CODE>
<DD>Sets the object's default help
panel within the help library. You better not mess with these settings, for you have
to know the WPS internal help resource IDs.

<P><DT><CODE><B>HIDEBUTTON</B>={YES|NO}</CODE>
<DD>Determine whether
views of this object have a
hide button as opposed to a
minimize button.
The default is the current
system Button appearance for
windows setting. This cannot
be specified here.

<P><DT><CODE><B>ICONFILE</B>=<I>filename</I></CODE>
<DD>Sets the object's icon. <CODE><I>filename</I></CODE>
must be a ".ICO" file.
For folders, this specifies the "closed" icon.

<P><DT><CODE><B>ICONPOS</B>=<I>x</I>,<I>y</I></CODE>
<DD>Sets the object's initial icon
position in the parent folder. The x
and y values represent the
position in the folder in
percentage coordinates.

<P><DT><CODE><B>ICONRESOURCE</B>=<I>id</I>,<I>dllfile</I></CODE>
<DD>Sets the object's icon to data residing in a resource file.
The <CODE><I>id</I></CODE> is the
icon resource ID in the dynamic link library (DLL)
<CODE><I>dllfile</I></CODE>.
For folders, this specifies the "closed" icon.

<P><DT><CODE><B>LOCKEDINPLACE</B>={YES|NO}</CODE> (&warp4; and higher only)
<DD>Specifies whether the object is fixed or not fixed in position.

<P><DT><CODE><B>MENUITEMSELECTED</B> <I>menu-item-id</I></CODE> (&warp4; and higher only)
<DD>Simulates selecting the specified
menu item from the object's popup menu.
<CODE><I>menu-item-id</I></CODE> must be a numeric value.
<BR>You may obtain the <CODE><I>menu-item-id</I></CODE> with the <CODE>XRAY</CODE> tool which
is available on the Internet. Or look on the respective
<A HREF="xices_4wpsmenuids.html">"WPS Menu IDs"</A> page.
(Hey, this setting works for XFolder menu items also, BTW.)
<BR>This is not really a "setting", but rather a command to be performed on the folder.

<P><DT><CODE><B>MENUS</B>={SHORT|LONG}</CODE> (&warp4; and higher only)
<DD>Determine whether this object has a short popup menu
(without menu entries that duplicate
drag 'n' drop functions) or the full one.

<P><DT><CODE><B>MINWIN</B>={HIDE|VIEWER|DESKTOP}</CODE>
<DD>Determine whether the minimized object will be hidden, placed into
the "Minimized Windows" view, or minimized to the desktop.
<P>The default is the current
Minimize button setting. This
cannot be specified here.

<P><DT><CODE><B>NOCOPY</B>={YES|NO}</CODE>
<DD>The object cannot be copied.

<P><DT><CODE><B>NODELETE</B>={YES|NO}</CODE>
<DD>The object cannot be deleted. Be careful
with this one.

<P><DT><CODE><B>NODRAG</B>={YES|NO}</CODE>
<DD>The object cannot be dragged with the mouse.

<P><DT><CODE><B>NODROP</B>={YES|NO}</CODE>
<DD>The object will not accept any objects
dropped upon it.

<P><DT><CODE><B>NOLINK</B>={YES|NO}</CODE>
<DD>No shadows can be created of this object.

<P><DT><CODE><B>NOMOVE</B>={YES|NO}</CODE>
<DD>The object cannot be moved.

<P><DT><CODE><B>NOPRINT</B>={YES|NO}</CODE>
<DD>The object cannot be printed.

<P><DT><CODE><B>NORENAME</B>={YES|NO}</CODE>
<DD>The object cannot be renamed.

<P><DT><CODE><B>NOSETTINGS</B>={YES|NO}</CODE>
<DD>The object's settings notebook cannot be opened.

<P><DT><CODE><B>NOSHADOW</B>={YES|NO}</CODE>
<DD>same as <CODE>NOLINK</CODE>.

<P><DT><CODE><B>NOTVISIBLE</B>={YES|NO}</CODE>
<DD>The object is not visible. Be careful with
this style, since you might not be able to get the object back.

<P><DT><CODE><B>OBJECTID</B>=<I>&lt;name&gt;</I></CODE>
<DD>Sets a persistent ID for the object.
An Object ID is any unique string preceded
with a <CODE>&lt;</CODE> and terminated with a <CODE>&gt;</CODE>.
<BR>Object IDs are useful for identifying objects without
knowing their exact location on the user's desktop.
For example, the desktop always has the ID <CODE>&lt;WP_DESKTOP&gt;</CODE>
on every system; the XFolder Configuration folder is assigned an ID of
<CODE>&lt;XFOLDER_CONFIG&gt;</CODE>, so that XFolder finds it even though
you might have moved it to a different location. See the
<A HREF="xices_2wpsobjids.html">"WPS Object IDs"</A> page for a listing of system IDs.
<P>Object IDs are even necessary to be able to locate abstract Desktop objects
(e.g. shadows or program objects) from REXX, since these objects do not
appear in the file system. So if you create an abstract object from REXX and
wish to be able to open it from REXX also, you must assign it an Object ID.
<P>The default is to not have an ID.

<P><DT><CODE><B>OPEN</B>={SETTINGS|DEFAULT|ICON|TREE|DETAILS}</CODE>
<DD>Open a view now.
This is the clever trick used by a zillion REXX scripts on the Internet to open an
object from the &os2; command line.
<BR><CODE>OPEN=DEFAULT</CODE> will open the default view of the object (as if
you had double-clicked on it). <CODE>OPEN=SETTINGS</CODE> will open the object's
settings notebook. All the other values are valid for folders only.
<BR>This is not really a "setting", but rather a command to be performed on the folder.
It will open immediately.

<P><DT><CODE><B>TEMPLATE</B>={YES|NO}</CODE>
<DD>Determines whether this object is a template or not.
Default is <CODE>NO</CODE> (of course).

<P><DT><CODE><B>TITLE</B>=<I>title</I></CODE>
<DD>Sets the object's title to something new. This will also change the
"real" filename (if the object represents a file), just as if you had
changed the title from the WPS.
