With the &xwp; Global Settings, you can make &xwp; behave differently.
Here you will find settings which affect &xwp; in general, such as its language
support, as well as settings which will affect your computer as a whole.
This is why they're called "global settings", as opposed to individual
folder settings, which are explained on a
<A HREF="fldr_7settings.html">separate page</A>.
<!-- V0.9.0: removed several paragraphs -->
<!-- V0.9.0: added the following -->
<P>The major features of &xwp; can be enabled or disabled in the new
<B>"&xwp; Setup"</B> object. Depending on the settings on the "Features" page,
certain parts of &xwp; will be completely disabled. This might be useful
if you are only interested in certain features or if you have problems with others.

<P>The detailed settings for the various &xwp; features however are in the
<B>"Workplace Shell"</B> object, which you will also find in your "System setup" folder.
<BR><IMG SRC="xfwps.gif">New "Workplace Shell" object
<P>Note that if you disable features in "&xwp; Setup", some settings pages
in "Workplace Shell" will not be shown if they don't make sense without a feature
being enabled.
<P>
The different settings pages are not explained in detail here. You will find
extensive help by pressing F1 or the "Help" button, which exists on every page.
