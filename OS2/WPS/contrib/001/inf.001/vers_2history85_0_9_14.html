<B>&xwp; 0.9.14 (August 26, 2001)</B>

<P>New features:

<UL><LI>General: Added SHOWRUNDLG setup string.

<P><LI>General: Since so many people didn't quite appreciate my beautiful
XWPSTART.LOG file, I added a setting for that on the "Startup" page in the
desktop's settings notebook.

<P><LI>Mouse: Martin Lafaix added a couple of settings to the "Auto-hide mouse"
feature and the general "Auto-move pointer to default push button" feature.
While I was at it, I added mouse pointer animations then.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Added another diskfree widget ("condensed" style).

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Added properties dlg to X-button widget for configuring the
menu items to display.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Added "Hide immediately on mouse click" setting.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Martin Lafaix added dragging widgets to open folders, which will
create a widget definition in a file, which can then be dropped to an &xcenter;
again. Experimental feature, no documentation yet.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Paul Ratcliffe added more options to the "Run" dialog.

<P><LI>Treesize: Added "100 largest files" function.

<P><LI>Status bars: Added "Keys" buttons to status bars page 2 in "Workplace Shell"
to list all the status bar keys that are supported by the corresponding entry field.

</UL><P>Miscellaneous changes:

<UL><LI>General: Greatly sped up dialog engine by caching font data, which affects
the new message boxes, among other things.

<P><LI>XWPSetup: Reworked the "XWorkplace Classes" setup dialog.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Optimized internal timers, which now use less CPU time
(depending on how many widgets are running). As a side effect, they
are even much more precise now.
Thanks Martin Lafaix for the oriental meditation hints.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Added more function imports to widget DLLs to reduce their sizes.

</UL>Bugfixes:

<UL><LI>General: New message boxes never had focus on default button. Besides,
the "snap back" for default buttons on tabbing didn't always work. Fixed.

<P><LI>General: Some message boxes didn't react to mouse clicks at all and could
only be dismissed via keyboard. Fixed.

<P><LI>General: Fixed a rounding problem in the font engine which caused wrong
font sized to be selected in some situations.

<P><LI>General: Fixed about a dozen memory leaks in various places.

<P><LI>General: Library routine which was used for starting applications
(among others, by &xcenter; "Run" dialog)
always hung the system for full-screen &winos2; sessions. Fixed by Paul Ratcliffe.

<P><LI>XFolder: Folder hotkeys for sort and arrange sorted the desktop
even if the respective menu items were disabled for the desktop. Fixed;
these are suppressed now to avoid accidentally sorting or arranging the
desktop.

<P><LI>XFolder: Fixed a number of problems with "Create another" in tree views,
most notably that the new object wouldn't appear unless the tree view had
SHOWALLINTREEVIEW set.

<P><LI>"OS/2 kernel" object: "Syslevels" page never displayed TCP/IP data, fixed.

<P><LI>"Keyboard" object: "Hotkeys" page never used 8.Helv font if enabled. Fixed
by Paul Ratcliffe.

<P><LI>Status bars: "Undo" on status bars page 2 in "Workplace Shell" didn't
undo everything. Fixed.

<P><LI>Hook: This allowed many things during lockup that weren't supposed to
happen, such as opening hot corner objects. Fixed.

<P><LI>&pgr;: I added a mutex around a global hook flag which is used by
&pgr; to avoid recursing into the hook. It looks like this has improved the
&pgr; hangs that occurred sporadically when many windows were opened and closed.
I am not sure yet if this completely fixed the problem.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Widget settings management crashed sometimes in an endless loop
when freeing settings data. Fixed by Paul Ratcliffe.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Widget properties dialogs never worked for subwidgets in a tray.
Fixed.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: If &xcenter; was on top of screen, menus weren't displayed in
the proper direction. Fixed for object buttons and X-button by Martin Lafaix.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: MB2 context menu on border or sizing bar broke with 0.9.13. Fixed by
Martin Lafaix.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Pulse widget broke with some recent version on some system, causing
crashes. Fixed, hopefully.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Trays sometimes lost their current tray between restarts. Fixed.
