&xwp;'s "sliding focus" feature is very similar to that offered by many
other PM hooks.

<P>Basically, this feature means that the keyboard input focus always follows
the mouse pointer. That is, if you move the mouse, the window under the mouse
pointer will be given the input focus (which means that also the title bar will
be made active).

<P>This behavior is very common with the various window managers running on the
X-Window windowing system used with the many flavors of UNIX, and Linux has
inherited this also. Since many people prefer to have this behavior
with &os2; too (including myself), this has been included with &xwp;.

<P>This feature can be <B>configured</B> in the "Mouse" object, which usually
resides in your "System Setup" folder. On the "Movement" page in that object,
there are several settings. Press the "Help" button on that page to find out more.

<P><B>Note:</B> That page is only visible if the XWPMouse class is installed
and the &xwp; hook has been enabled in
<A HREF="sys_1intro.html">"&xwp; Setup".</A>

<P>The main advantage of this feature is that for one, you don't have to click
into a window to be able to use the keyboard with it. Also, if you have disabled
the "Bring window to top" setting on the "Mouse hook" page, you can even type
into a window which is not the topmost window, which is impossible without the
"Sliding focus" feature. This takes a bit of getting used to, but this can be
very handy when several windows are opened and you need to view one window's
information while typing into another.

<P><B>Notes</B>

<OL><LI>There's no way to make this feature work properly
with <B>seamless &winos2; windows.</B> The 16-bit Windows graphics engine
(Graphical Device Interface, GDI) is not
capable of differentiating between a "topmost" and an "active" window; it simply
assumes that the topmost window must always be the active one.
This limitation applies to seamless &winos2; windows also, which use the 16-bit
Windows graphics engine internally.

<P>For this reason, there is a special setting on the "Movement" page in the
"Mouse" settings notebook for &winos2; windows. You can either decide to always
bring &winos2; windows to the top, or to ignore them completely. It is however not
possible to make them active without bringing them to the top.
Otherwise you'd get really strange repainting errors on your screen,
because the GDI would repaint an active &winos2; window completely even if other windows
are on top of it (because it assumes it must be the topmost window).

<P>Of course, full-screen &winos2; sessions are not affected by &xwp; in any
way, because the &xwp; PM hook does not deal with &winos2; fullscreen sessions.

<P><LI>While the <B>PM window list</B> (or tasklist) is showing on the screen, the
sliding focus feature is temporarily disabled. This is necessary because the window
list automatically disappears when it loses the keyboard focus. If the sliding focus
weren't disabled while the window list is showing, it would become difficult to do
anything with the window list at all, because it would kept disappearing if the mouse
pointer was not over it.
