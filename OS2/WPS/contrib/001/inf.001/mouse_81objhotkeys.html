Starting with V0.9.0, &xwp; also introduces "object hotkeys", which means
that you can open any object in its default view by pressing a certain hotkey
combination, which you can define individually for each object.

<P>As with all &xwp; hook features, object hotkeys are disabled per default.
You need to enable them in the "&xwp; setup" object first.

<P><B>Note:</B> Do not confuse object hotkeys with
<A HREF="fldr_5xelerators.html">folder hotkeys,</A> as
displayed in the "Workplace Shell" settings object. Object hotkeys are
used to open objects using a key definition and work everywhere, while folder
hotkeys are shortcuts to certain folder commands and work in folders only.

<P>Object hotkeys can be <B>configured</B> in two places. For one, &xwp; inserts
a new "Object" page into each single <B>object's settings notebook.</B> This applies
to really all objects (that is, folders, files, printers, program objects, etc.).
By clicking into the "Hotkey" entry field, you may define a key combination for
that object. From then on, if you press this key combination anywhere on your system,
the object will be opened in its default view (as if you had double-clicked on it).

<P>Secondly, &xwp; inserts a new page into the <B>"Keyboard" settings object,</B>
which per default resides in your "System Setup" folder. On this new page, which
is called "Hotkeys" for some reason, all currently defined object hotkeys are
listed.

<P>There are some <B>limitations</B> with respect to object hotkeys. Since hotkey
detection is done in the &xwp; PM hook, object hotkeys only work in the
Presentation Manager (PM) screen session. This includes all PM applications, the
WPS itself, plus windowed (seamless) &os2;, DOS and &winos2; sessions,
but <I>not</I> DOS, &os2; or &winos2; <I>fullscreen</I> sessions, unfortunately.
