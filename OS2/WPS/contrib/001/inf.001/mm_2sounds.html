If you have the &os2; multimedia subsystem (MMPM/2) with any sound card installed,
&xwp; can play additional system sounds on certain occasions, just as
older XFolder versions did already.

<P>If you enable the "Extended system sounds" in
"&xwp; Setup", &xwp; will add new events to the "Sound" page in the
"Sound" object.

<P>Please note that the &xwp; system sounds will make your system slower, just
as the regular system sounds do too. Even on my Pentium-133 with 32 MB RAM, this is
noticeable, even though &xwp; uses a separate thread to play its sounds.

<P>Configuring these new sounds is not too spectacular: &xwp; just adds a few
more items to the events list box on the "Sounds" page.
All the &xwp; items start with "&xwp;", so you'll be able to view them grouped
together.

<P>You can find a few small sounds in the <CODE>WAV</CODE> subdirectory of
the &xwp; installation directory to get you started. <CODE>;-)</CODE>

<P><B>Implementation.</B> To introduce these features, several components of
&xwp; are interacting. To intercept system events for the new system sounds,
the XFolder and XFldDesktop classes need to be installed. However, the new
XWPSound class replacement (see the <A HREF="mm_1sndobj.html">previous page</A>)
is not required for the new system sounds. That class only makes configuration easier.
