    /*
     *@@ XCENTERGLOBALS:
     *      global data for a running &xcenter; instance.
     *      A pointer to this structure exists in each
     *      XCENTERWIDGET instance so that the widgets
     *      can access some of the global data.
     *
     *      In this structure, an &xcenter; instance
     *      passes a number of variables to its member
     *      widgets so that they can access some things
     *      more quickly for convenience. This structure
     *      is fully initialized at the time the widgets
     *      are created.
     *
     *      "Globals" isn't really a good name since
     *      one of these structures is created for
     *      each open &xcenter; (and there can be several),
     *      but this is definitely more global than the
     *      widget-specific structures.
