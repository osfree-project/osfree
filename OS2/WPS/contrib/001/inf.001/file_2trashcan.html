<B>Classes: XFldObject, XWPTrashCan, XWPTrashObject</B><HR>
Starting with V0.9.0, &xwp; introduces a trash can too.
<IMG SRC="file_2trashcan.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT>

<P>Most people are probably familiar with this feature, because the MacOS, Windows 95 and
KDE (on Linux) offer this feature as well. Basically, the trash can temporarily stores
all the objects that have been deleted on the system, so you can get them back in case
you have accidentally deleted something by opening the trash can (which behaves like
any folder) and restoring an object.
<!-- V0.9.3: added the following -->
<P>With &xwp;, the trash can will intercept all WPS "delete" operations. (It will
<I>not</I> intercept command line operations or the &os2; <CODE>DELDIR</CODE> setting.)

<!-- V0.9.3: added the following paragraph -->
<P><B>Note:</B> The trash can is not automatically created during installation,
and trash can "delete" support is initially disabled to avoid confusion.
For the trash can to work, enable it
on the "Features" page in the <A HREF="sys_2global.html">"&xwp; Setup" object.</A>

<P><B>Deleting</B> an object into the trash can be done in two ways:

<OL><LI><B>Drag and drop</B> the object(s) onto the trash can icon or into an open
trash can view.

<!-- V0.9.7: changed the following paragraph -->
<P><LI>&xwp; can also intercept the <B>WPS "Delete" commands.</B>
This applies to the menu item in each object's context menu as well as the
"Delete" key when it's pressed in a folder window. Both actions will then move
the selected objects into the trash can first instead of really deleting them.
<!-- V0.9.3: removed this
Note: For the second option to work, you need to enable this feature
changed the following link with V0.9.1
on the "Features" page in the "&xwp; Setup" object.
This is disabled per default to avoid confusion. -->

<!-- V0.9.3: added this -->
<P>You can still perform a "true" delete (that is, really delete the object, instead
of moving it into the trash can) by holding down the "Shift" key while clicking on
the "Delete" menu item in an object's context menu

</OL>Once the objects are in the trash can, you can either have them <B>destroyed</B>
(which will really delete the object) or <B>restored</B> (which will put the object
back to the location where it was deleted from).
<P><IMG SRC="trashcan.gif">

<P>Also, when any objects are in the trash can, the trash can object itself has an
additional menu item called <B>"Empty trash can"</B>, which will delete <I>all</I>
the objects in the trash can for good.

<P>The trash can has a new settings page in its settings notebook, with additional
features. Press <B>"Help"</B> on that page for more information.

<P>If you're interested in details about how the trash can works internally, please
see the <A HREF="further_2howxtrash.html">respective page</A> in the
"&xwp; Internals" section.
