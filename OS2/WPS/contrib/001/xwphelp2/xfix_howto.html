        xfix: How Can I...

<BODY>
Here are some typical tasks that xfix can help you with.

<UL><LI><B>Finding outdated file handles</B>

<P>In order to have xfix check all file handles for whether they still point
to valid physical files, select "Find invalid files" from the "Actions" menu.

<P>This task can take a while since xfix will have to check each of the "long names"
in the handles list for whether the file name is valid. You will hear your hard
disk rattle, but don't worry, xfix is only looking for files and will not alter them.

<P>When xfix is done with this, all outdated handles will be marked invalid
(with a gray emphasis) and their status will be set to "File not found".

<P>Read on at the bottom of this text for how to remove these.

<P><LI><B>Fixing duplicate handles</B>

<P>This task was the real reason why this program was written in the first place,
since my file handles were messed up so badly at one point that not even CHECKINI
was able to fix this any more.

<P>When duplicate file handles exist, the WPS gets totally confused pretty soon,
and more and more duplicates are added to the file handle blocks, until one day
the WPS won't even find your Desktop any more.

<P>When xfix is initially started, it will automatically detect duplicate file handles.
Those are marked invalid (with a gray emphasis), and you will find a "duplicate"
string in the second column for those entries.

</UL>To <B>remove invalid entries</B> after having performed one of the above
steps, do this:

<OL><LI>Select "Status" from the "Sort" menu to have all entries with an invalid status
moved to the bottom. (Again, these are given a gray background.)

<LI>Scroll down to find those entries.

<LI>Select all invalid entries manually, or use "Select all invalid" from
the menu.

<LI>Right-click on one of the selected items and choose "Delete".

<LI>From the "xfix" menu, select "Write back to OS2.INI".

</OL>
