Every object has a title associated with it. There are several ways to
change an object's title:

<UL><LI>You can open the object's
<A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A> and change
the title on the "Icon" page.

<P><LI>You can <B>click</B> on the object with the <B>"Alt" key</B> held
down. This allows you to edit the title directly in the folder window.

</UL><B>Remarks:</B>

<OL><LI>Some objects may refuse to be renamed if the object's
title is critical to its operation. You may also not be able to rename
an object if it is on a remote network drive to which you do not have
write access.

<P><LI>If you change the title of a
<A HREF="tasks/tsk_crshadow.html">shadow</A>, the original object will
also be renamed.
