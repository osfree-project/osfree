Depending on the type of an object, a variety of operations can
be performed on it, either with the use of a dialog window or
via
<A HREF="glossary/gls_dragdrop.html">drag and drop</A>
with the mouse.

<UL><LI>To <B>move objects,</B> select "Move" from the &popmenu; of the
selected objects, or drag and drop them with the <B>"Shift" key</B>
held down.

<P><LI>To <B>copy objects,</B> select "Copy" from the &popmenu; of the
selected objects, or drag and drop them with the <B>"Ctrl" key</B>
held down.

<P><LI>To <B>create shadows of objects,</B> select "Create shadow"
from the &popmenu; of the selected objects, or drag and drop them with
both the <B>"Shift" and "Ctrl" keys</B> held down.

<P>See <A HREF="tasks/tsk_crshadow.html">"About shadows"</A> for an
introduction.

</UL>If you do not hold down any of the Shift or Ctrl keys while
dragging, a default operation will be performed that depends on
the source and the target of the operation. For example, when you
drag between folders, in most cases, objects will be moved by default.
However, if you drag to the Desktop, by default the system creates
shadows. Finally, if you drag <A HREF="objects/obj_pgmf.html">program files</A>,
by default the system creates
&link_progobjs; for them.

<P><B>Remarks:</B>

<OL><LI>If you copy or move an entire <A HREF="objects/obj_fdr_main.html">folder</A>,
all of its contents, including
all subfolders, will also be copied or moved. Be aware that such
an operation can take a long time, depending on the number of bytes
that have to be physically copied between drives. However, moving
files between folders on the <I>same</I> drive is generally very fast
because the file system can usually just update directory information
instead of physically moving data.

<P>Also make sure
that there is enough free space on the target drive to hold the entire
folder tree. You can use <A HREF="treesize.html">Treesize</A> to find out
how much space an entire folder hierarchy takes.

<P><LI>Copying or moving a <A HREF="tasks/tsk_crshadow.html">shadow</A>
does not copy or move the original object, but the shadow only.

<P><LI>If you are moving files between different drives, be
aware that there might be file-system restrictions. See
<A HREF="tasks/tsk_copymovefs.html">"Restrictions when copying and moving files"</A>
for details.
