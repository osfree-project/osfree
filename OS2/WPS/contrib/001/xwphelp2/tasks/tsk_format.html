To prepare a diskette or hard disk
<A HREF="glossary/gls_volume.html">volume</A> for first time use, you must
<B>format</B> it. Formatting removes any information previously stored
on a storage medium (if any) and organizes the medium so that the operating
system can use it.

<P>This organization is called a
<A HREF="glossary/gls_fs.html">file system</A>. For hard disks volumes,
there are several file systems available, so you have to tell the system
what file system you would like to use when formatting.

<P><B>Warning:</B> Be sure to check the diskette or hard disk before
you format it. Formatting destroys all data on the medium, if any is
present.
