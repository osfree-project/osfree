<BODY>
<!-- V0.9.16: changed the following -->
The "Details" page in disk properties notebooks shows you additional file-system
information of a disk object.
<IFNDEF __NOXWPSETUP__>
&xwp; replaces the "Details" page in disk properties notebooks with
a new, enhanced page. To get the original "Details" page back, disable
the respective setting in the
<!-- V0.9.2: link added -->
<A HREF="objects/obj_xwpsetup.html">"&xwp; Setup" object</A>.
</IFNDEF>
<P>Except for the "Drive label" field, this information cannot be changed from
this page.
<!-- end V0.9.16 -->

<OL><LI>The <B>"Drive details"</B> group offers you the following information:

<BR><OL><LI><B>Drive label:</B> This is the file-system level drive label as you might have
entered it on the
<IFNDEF __EWORKPLACE__>
&os2;
</IFNDEF>
command line using the <CODE>LABEL</CODE> command.
&xwp; now allows you to change the drive label on the notebook page, without
having to use the command line. This might be useful because many "File open"
dialogs show you the drive labels, since they have no access to the WPS's disk object
title.
<P>
The drive level is limited to 11 characters and will always be converted to upper case.

<P><LI><B>File system:</B> the file-system type of the disk. This is probably either
"FAT", "HPFS", "JFS", or "CDFS" (for CD-ROM drives). There may be other file-system
types, if you have additional Installable File Systems (IFS's) installed.

<!-- V0.9.13: added this line -->
<P>See <A HREF="glossary/gls_fs.html">"File systems"</A> for an introduction to file systems.

<!-- V0.9.12: renamed "bytes per sector" -->
<P><LI><B>Block size:</B> This shows you the size of the minimum allocation unit
on the disk. That is, if a file of 1 byte length is created, at least this number
of bytes will be allocated on the disk.

<P>For <B>HPFS volumes,</B> this number should always be 512.

<!-- V0.9.12: added JFS -->
<P>For <B>JFS volumes,</B> this number depends on what was specified when the
volume was formatted. JFS allows block sizes of 512, 1024, 2048, and 4096, where
4096 is the default.

<P>For <B>FAT volumes,</B> the block size depends on the size of the disk. Since the
file allocation tables on FAT volumes can only handle a limited number of blocks,
for larger disks, more bytes have to be used for each blocks. As a result, the larger
your FAT volumes are, the more bytes are wasted because of growing block sizes:

</OL><LI>The <B>"Allocation"</B> group offers you information about the disk's
usage. Total size, allocated and free space space are shown in bytes
and blocks, where the "Bytes" information is the "Block" information
multiplied by the "Block size" information above.
<P>
In addition, you now get a pie chart showing you the free space on the
disk (in green).
