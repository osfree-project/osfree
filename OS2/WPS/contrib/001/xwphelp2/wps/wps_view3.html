<BODY>
On this notebook page you can determine in great detail
what menu items should be visible for all objects on the
system.

<P>You can determine the visible menu items differently
for several <B>object categories.</B> To determine the menu items
for a certain category, first select the category from
the drop-down box on the top of the page. Then select or
deselect the menu items that you would like to be visible.

<P>Note that the category settings do not inherit from
each other. That is, for example, even though the Desktop
is really a special folder, this does not mean that disabling
an item for the "folders" category will also disable the item
for the Desktop. This allows you, for example, to disable the
"Sort" and "Arrange" menu items for the Desktop only in order
to avoid accidentally sorting the Desktop.

<P>Certain menu items are <B>disabled</B> if you cannot remove
them from the menus, either because they are required for
the proper operation of the Workplace Shell or because you
have enabled the "Short menu" style on the first "Menu" page.

<P>Press <B>"Undo"</B> to restore the settings
for all categories that were in use before you opened this notebook page.
<P>Press <B>"Default"</B> to restore the settings
to the installation state, which will enable
all menu items for all categories.

<P>Note that more menu items may be added to folder menus according to
the contents of the special &cfgfdr;.
See <A HREF="menus/menu_3config.html">Configuring &popmenu;s</A> for details.
