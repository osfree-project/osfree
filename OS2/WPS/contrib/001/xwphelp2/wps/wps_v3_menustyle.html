In the <B>"Menu style"</B> group, you can
set whether the system should use long or short object menus.
If you select <B>"Short menus",</B> all functions that
can also be accessed via mouse or keyboard will be removed.
This applies to items like "Copy", "Move", "Create shadow" etc.
(You can override this setting individually in each folder's
<A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>.)

<P>Note that on the following notebook page, you can still select
in detail which menu items should be visible for object menus.
