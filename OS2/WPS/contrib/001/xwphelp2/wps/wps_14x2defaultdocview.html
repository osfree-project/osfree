If the <A HREF="wps/wps_14x1defaultdoc.html">"default documents" feature</A> has been enabled,
this will automatically make the "Folder's default document" item in a folder's "Open" &popmenu;
the default view for the folder if a default document exists.

<P>In other words, if you declare a document a default document for its folder, you can then
simply double-click on the folder to have the default document opened instead.

<P>See the <I>"&xwp; User Guide"</I> for an introduction to this feature.

<P>Changing this setting affects all folders immediately.
