<!-- V0.9.19: title changed -->
<BODY>
This setting determines whether &xwp; will collect all the icons when displaying
<!-- V0.9.19: link added -->
<A HREF="menus/menu_content.html">folder content menus</A>,
similar to the way the &warpcenter; displays its submenus.

<!-- V0.9.19: removed this, it's no longer valid
Disable this setting if you experience problems on your computer when folder
content menus are displayed. Some users have reported system crashes in this situation.
This is most probably related to video driver bugs, especially with the Matrox
Millenium drivers. -->

<P>Note that enabling this setting will slow down the folder content functions,
because collecting and displaying all the icons in a folder takes some additional
time and memory.

<!-- V0.9.19: refreshed the following -->
<IFNDEF __NOFOLDERCONTENTS__>
<P>This setting applies to all folder content menus on the system.
It also affects the folder content menus that are added because
you have declared a folder to be your "favorite" folder on the "View" page in its
<A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>. Besides, it will
affect the menus for
<A HREF="xcenter/xc_objbtn.html">object button widgets</A> in the
<A HREF="xcenter/xc_main.html">&xcenter;</A>.
</IFNDEF>
