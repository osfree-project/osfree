        Make Title Editable
    </TITLE>

<!-- V0.9.16: replace XFolder with &xwp; -->
<BODY>
Selecting this setting will cause &xwp; to
make the title of an object editable, if you have created it from a
<!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="tasks/tsk_templates.html">template</A>,
as if you had
Alt-clicked on it. This happens only when the folder in which the object was
created is currently open, of course.

<P>This applies only to templates in the &cfgfdr;. Dragging
new objects from a template with the mouse will not be affected.

<P>Note that &os2; sometimes has problems with this, as the
title becomes editable for a moment and then, for some reason, the folder seems
to be automatically refreshed and the editing mode is cancelled.

<P>Even if you select this setting,
you can still always have the settings opened
if you hold down a <B>Shift key</B> while selecting the template menu item.
