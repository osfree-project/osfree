<BODY>
If "Desktop follows active window" is <B>checked</B> (which is the default
setting), &pgr; will automatically switch desktops if a window becomes
active that is on a desktop other than the current one. This makes
sure that if, for example, an application displays a pop-up message,
it is switched to automatically.

<P>If the setting is <B>unchecked,</B> the automatic switching is disabled.
You will have to manually switch desktops to get to the active window then.
