If object hotkeys are enabled in the
<!-- V0.9.2: link added -->
<A HREF="objects/obj_xwpsetup.html">"&xwp; Setup" object</A>,
&xwp; inserts the "Hotkeys" page into the "Keyboard" object's properties notebook.
<P>
</IFNDEF>

This page allows you to view all currently defined object hotkeys at
once and configure and remove hotkeys.

<P><B>Note:</B> Do not confuse object hotkeys with folder hotkeys, as
displayed in the <!-- V0.9.4: link added -->
<A HREF="objects/obj_wps.html">"Workplace Shell" object.</A>
Object hotkeys are
used to open objects using a key definition and work everywhere, while folder
hotkeys are shortcuts to certain folder commands and work in folders only.

<P>The "Hotkeys" page lists all hotkeys which are currently defined on the
system in a container which looks similar to a folder Details view.

<P>By clicking on a hotkey item with <B>mouse button 2,</B> you will get a
<!-- V0.9.19: link added -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_popmenu.html">&popmenu;</A>
which allows you to open the object's &popmenu;, open the object's
folder, or remove the hotkey altogether.

<P>To <B>change a hotkey,</B> select "Object properties" from the
&popmenu; and switch to the
<!-- V0.9.16: change "Object" to "Icon" -->
"Icon"
page in the object's properties notebook which has opened.
This allows you to define a new object hotkey.
