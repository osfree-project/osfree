<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.13 -->
<BODY>
The <B>"Autocheck"</B> parameter determines for which
<!-- V0.9.20: replace drives with volumes -->
volumes JFS will automatically perform a <CITE>CHKDSK</CITE> at system startup.

<P>Simply enter the respective drive letters here (without the trailing "<CITE>:</CITE>").

<P>Note however that the meaning of this parameter is slightly different compared to
the corresponding parameter of <CODE>HPFS.IFS</CODE>:

<UL><LI>If you specify <CODE>*</CODE> only (which is the default), all JFS
<!-- V0.9.20: replace drives with volumes -->
volumes will automatically be checked by replaying the journal log. Note that JFS will
not only check <!-- V0.9.20: replace drives with volumes -->
volumes that have been marked as "dirty" (i.e. not properly shut
down), but replay the journal log <I>always</I> on startup.

<LI>If you specify a plus sign (<CITE>+</CITE>) <I>before</I> a drive letter here,
JFS will not only replay the journal log on that drive, but will perform a full
integrity check as well.

<LI>If the list ends with <CODE>+*</CODE>, JFS will perform a full integrity check
on all <!-- V0.9.20: replace drives with volumes -->
volumes that were not specified in the list.

</UL>Example: If you enter <CITE>C+DE</CITE>, drive D: will receive a full check,
while C: and E: will only have their journal logs replayed.
