This page allows you to take a look at the most important
<!-- V0.9.20: link added -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_path_sys.html">system path</A>
entries
in &cfgsys; and find out which entries are invalid.

<P><B>Note:</B> Take extreme caution in modifying the system paths. One
invalid modification might render your whole system unusable.

<P>Press <B>"Apply"</B> to have the changes you've made written to the
&cfgsys; file. This will write the changes to all system paths available
in the drop-down box, not just the changes of the path that is currently
selected.
You will have to restart the computer to let the changes
take effect. A Desktop restart does <I>not</I> suffice.

<P>The <B>"System paths to check"</B> drop-down box offers you a selection
of system paths that can be modified using this page.
<!-- V0.9.20: moved all the syspath explanations to glossary/gls_path_sys.html
and replaced them with this link -->
See <A HREF="glossary/gls_path_sys.html">"System paths"</A> for more explanations.

<P>Once you select a &cfgsys; item, the paths that are specified with it
in &cfgsys; are displayed in the list box below. You can then select items
in that list box and use the buttons to have them modified. This should be
pretty self-explanatory.

<P>The <B>"Select invalid"</B> which select all path entries that are not
valid directories on your system. You can then press <B>"Delete"</B> afterwards
to have these entries removed.
