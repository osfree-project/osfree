<BODY>
On this page you may set a few WPS settings in &cfgsys;.
<P>If the information on this page regarding the different &cfgsys; settings is
not sufficient for you, you'll find additional explanations in the respective chapters
of the <I>&os2; Command Reference.</I>

<P>Press <B>"Apply"</B> to have the changes you've made written to the
&cfgsys; file.
This will only change the &cfgsys; lines which correspond to the settings on this
page. The lines corresponding to the other pages in the "&os2; Kernel" object will
not be changed.
This button is only active if you have made any changes to the settings
on this page. Please note that you will have to restart the computer to let the changes
take effect. A Desktop restart does <I>not</I> suffice.
<P>Press <B>"Optimize"</B> to have &xwp; propose you new settings according to
your system characteristics.
&cfgsys; will only be changed after you press "Apply" also.
<P>Press <B>"Default"</B> to have the &os2; default settings displayed on the notebook
page.
&cfgsys; will only be changed after you press "Apply" also.

<P>In the <B>"Autostart"</B> group you may set what will be started when your
computer is booting up. This corresponds to the
<CITE>SET AUTOSTART=xxx</CITE> setting in &cfgsys;, with "xxx" being:
<UL><LI><CITE>PROGRAMS</CITE>: If you deactivate this, no <B>programs</B> can be started,
except for the programs in the "System startup" folder.
<BR><LI><CITE>TASKLIST</CITE>: If you deactivate this, the <B>tasklist</B> will not be
shown.
<BR><LI><CITE>FOLDERS</CITE>: if you could disable this, no folders would be opened, and
neither would be the Desktop. This is why this entry is not displayed on the notebook
page and will always be added by &xwp;.
<BR><LI><CITE>CONNECTIONS</CITE>: If you deactivate this, no
<B>network connections</B> will be started.
<BR><LI><CITE>LAUNCHPAD</CITE>: If you disable this, the <B>Launchpad</B> will not be
started. But you can still place it in the "System startup" folder or start it
manually.
<BR><LI><CITE>WARPCENTER</CITE>: If you disable this, the <B>&warpcenter;</B> will not be
started. This entry is only valid for OS/2 Warp 4 and above.
But you can still place it in the "System startup" folder or start it
manually.

</UL>By default, all entries are enabled.

<P>In the group <B>"Restart after system startup..."</B> you may determine which
objects will be restarted after the WPS has booted. This corresponds to the
<B>SET RESTARTOBJECTS=xxx</B> setting in &cfgsys;:
<UL><LI><B>"All"</B> (<CITE>SET RESTARTOBJECTS=YES</CITE>) will start all objects that
were open when the system was shut down the last time. Unfortunately,
this is the default value. <B>Note:</B> Restarting all objects does not work if you
are using &xwp;'s eXtended Shutdown.
<BR><LI><B>"Nothing"</B> (<CITE>=NO</CITE>) does not restart any objects, not even those in the "System startup"
folder. (But it does start those in the &xwp; Startup folder).
<BR><LI><B>"Startup folders only"</B> (<CITE>=STARTUPFOLDERSONLY</CITE>) will only restart the objects in the &os2;
System startup folder. This setting is strongly recommended because the default setting
can lead to enormous problems if a program has taken down the system and will then
be restarted. In addition, &xwp; assumes that you have this setting enabled.
<BR><LI><B>"After reboot only"</B> (<CITE>REBOOT ONLY</CITE>) will only restart anything
if the system was just (re-)booted and not after the WPS is restarting after an error.
This makes sense only if you use the "All" option above.

</UL>With Warp 4, you may also disable the setting <B>"Automatically refresh folders",</B>
which is enabled by default. In this case open folders are only refreshed if you
perform this manually, because the auto-refresh sometimes costs a lot of time.
This setting corresponds to
<CITE>SET AUTOREFRESHFOLDERS=xxx</CITE> (with xxx = YES or NO).

<!-- V1.0.8: added new option -->
<P>The option <B>"Additional file handles"</B> allows you to increase the number
of files that can be open at a time for the WPS. The value is also inherited by
other processes. This setting corresponds to
<CITE>SET SHELLHANDLESINC=xxx</CITE> with xxx being a number between zero and 255.

<P>In some situations, the WPS might run out of file handles and thus cannot open any
additional files. The problem can also occur with applications that do not request
the required amount of file handles but rely on a suitable default to be set. This
problem can be worked around by specifying a large enough number in the above option.

<P>The option is only effective on OS/2 Warp 4 Fixpak 6 and later.
<BR>
