        &os2; Kernel: HPFS Autocheck
    </TITLE>

<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.5 -->
<BODY>

The <B>"Autocheck"</B> entry field corresponds to the
/AUTOCHECK:xxx in the HPFS or HPFS386 &cfgsys; command line.
Here you can determine for which
<!-- V0.9.20: replace drives with volumes -->
volumes &os2; will automatically perform a
<CITE>CHKDSK</CITE> at system startup.
<P>Simply enter the respective drive letters here (without the trailing "<CITE>:</CITE>").
&os2; will check each drive that you specify here at system startup if you have not
shut down your system properly (for example, after a black-screen crash).

<P>If you specify a plus sign ("<CITE>+</CITE>")
<I>before</I> a drive letter here, that drive will always be checked, which is not
really preferrable.
<P>Example: If you enter "<CITE>C+DE</CITE>", drive D: will always be checked, while
C: and E: only if needed.

<P><B>Note:</B> For HPFS <!-- V0.9.20: replace drives with volumes -->
volumes, the auto-check is absolutely necessary because accessing
"dirty" HPFS volumes will result in system errors. You should enter all your
HPFS <!-- V0.9.20: replace drives with volumes -->
volumes here because &os2; will print error messages at startup otherwise. This
applies especially to your boot
<!-- V0.9.20: replace drive with volume -->
volume, or &os2; will refuse to boot altogether if you
forgot to shut down or the system crashed.
<P>Press the <B>"Propose"</B> button to have all the HPFS
<!-- V0.9.20: replace drives with volumes -->
volumes of your system
added to the entry field.
