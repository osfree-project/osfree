The "Paste" dialog allows you to create a new file in the current folder that
receives the current contents of the &os2;
<A HREF="glossary/gls_clipboard.html">clipboard</A>.

<P>In the dialog, the <B>"Preview"</B> field shows you the current contents of the
clipboard. This is what the new file will contain.

<P>In the <B>"Object title"</B> field, enter a name for the object that you
want to create. The dialog remembers the last 10 object titles that you have
entered in the list under the entry field.

<P>From the list under the <B>"Format"</B> field, select the format that shall
be used for copying the clipboard data to the new file. Depending on the
application that produced the current clipboard contents, there may be several
formats available.

<P>From the list under the <B>"Object class"</B> field, select the
<A HREF="glossary/gls_wpsclasses.html">Workplace Shell Class</A> for the new object. The
contents of the list depend on the format that is selected in the list
above.

<P>After you have made your selections, press "OK" to have the new object
created.
