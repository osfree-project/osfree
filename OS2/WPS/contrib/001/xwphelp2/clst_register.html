This dialog allows you to register a new
<!-- V0.9.13: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_wpsclasses.html">WPS class</A>.
This is only useful if you know
both the
<!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_dll.html">dynamic link library (DLL)</A>
which contains a class and the exact name of this class. &xwp; cannot
help you with this.

<P>In the <B>"DLL"</B> field, enter the DLL which contains the class.
If this DLL resides on the
<!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_path_sys.html"><CODE>LIBPATH</CODE></A>,
you do not need to specify its full
<!-- V0.9.20: link added -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_path.html">path</A>.
You can press "Browse..." however to find a DLL with a full path.

<P>In the <B>"Class"</B> field, enter the exact name of the class to be registered.
Note that -- unlike file names -- class names are case-sensitive. If you misspell the
name or confuse upper and lower case, registering the class will fail.

<P>The <B>OK</B> button is disabled until you have entered something in both fields.
No error checking is performed. Pressing OK will attempt to register the class using
<!-- V0.9.20: changed this -->
the <A HREF="pmref.inf#WinRegisterClass"><CODE>WinRegisterClass</CODE></A> API<A HREF="_toolkitlink.html">*</A>

<P>Note that in most cases the new class can be used immediately without having to
restart the Desktop.
