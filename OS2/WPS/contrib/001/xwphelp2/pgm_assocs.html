<!-- V1.0.2: replaced "extended file types" with "turbo folders" -->
If turbo folders have been enabled in the
<A HREF="objects/obj_xwpsetup.html">"&xwp; Setup" object</A>,
&xwp; replaces the original "Associations" page in program
properties notebooks with an enhanced version.
</IFNDEF>

<P>On the "Associations" page, you may set the file types that
this program is associated with.

<P>See <A HREF="glossary/gls_assocs.html">Types and associations</A> for an
introduction to associations between data files and programs.

<P>This page displays all file types in a tree, as they were defined
on the "File types" page in the
&link_wpsobj;. As opposed
to that page, each file type on this page has a check box next to it
which determines whether the program is currently associated with
data files of that type.

<UL><LI>If a box is <B>checked,</B> the respective association is currently
set for the program. To remove the association, click onto the
check box.

<P><LI>If a box is <B>unchecked,</B> the respective type association is not
currently set for the program. Click onto the check box to add an
association.
