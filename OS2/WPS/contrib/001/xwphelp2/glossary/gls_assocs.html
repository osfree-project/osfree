In the Workplace Shell, associations link data files to
<!-- V0.9.20: replaced this line -->
&link_progobjs;.

<IFNDEF __NOXWPSETUP__>
If extended file types have been enabled in the
<A HREF="objects/obj_xwpsetup.html">"&xwp; Setup" object</A>,
this is done entirely with the use of file types.
</IFNDEF>

<P>The <B>type</B> of a data file depends on two sources:

<UL><LI>You can explicitly set a type on the "Types" page
of a data file's <A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>.
This type is stored in the
<!-- V0.9.20: link added -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_eas.html">extended attributes</A>
of the file and remain there unless you remove it again.

<P><LI>In addition, &xwp; also associates file types
automatically according to so-called "filters", which are
strings containing the standard
<A HREF="glossary/gls_wildcards.html">wildcards</A>
"*" and/or "?".

<P>These file type filters can be defined on the "File types" page in the
&link_wpsobj;. For example,
you can create a file type "Acrobat PDF" with the filter <CODE>*.PDF</CODE>,
and all such files will automatically receive that type.

</UL>If a program object has been <B>associated</B> with a file
type, the program object appears in the "Open" submenu of the
<!-- V0.9.19: link added -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_popmenu.html">&popmenu;s</A>
of all data files which have that type. The first association
determines the icon of the data file and is also used when
you double-click on the file.

<P>In the above example, if you now associate the "Acrobat PDF" type
with the program object for the Adobe Acrobat Reader, all files
matching <CODE>*.PDF</CODE> can be opened with that program object.

<P>In addition, file types may <B>inherit</B> from each other. You
can define those parent-child relationships on the "File types" page in the
&link_wpsobj;, simply by dragging
the file types around. If a type has thus been made a child of another type,
the associations for the parent type will also be available for all data files
of the child type.

<P>For example, assume that you also have defined a "PostScript" file type.
Since PDF documents are really special PostScript files, you can make
"Acrobat PDF" a child type of "PostScript". If you have, say, a GhostScript
association for the "PostScript" type, your PDF files can then also be
opened with the GhostScript program.
