<BODY>
Substitution variables are specified as <CODE>%0</CODE> through <CODE>%9</CODE>.
When these variables are encountered in a batch or command file, the
command processor replaces them, in sequence, with the arguments that
were given to the file.

<P>&os2; reads the percent sign (<CODE>%</CODE>) as a command rather than
as a regular input character.  If you intend to use the percent sign as
an input character, you must specify it twice (e.g. as in <CODE>ABC%%.IN</CODE>).

<P>If you need more than nine variables, you can use the
<A HREF="cmdref.inf#SHIFT"><CODE>SHIFT</CODE></A> command.
