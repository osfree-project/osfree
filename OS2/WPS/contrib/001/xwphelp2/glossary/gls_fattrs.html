<BODY>
&os2;, like DOS and Windows, assigns attributes to each directory or
file in the <A HREF="glossary/gls_fs.html">file-system</A>.

<P>The following attributes exist:

<OL><BR><LI>The <B>"Archive"</B> bit is a user
flag which is set by the operating system any time the file is changed; this
is reset by many backup utilities to allow for checking whether the file needs
to be archived again, because it has changed since the last backup.

<P><LI>The <B>"Read only"</B> flag can be set for files which must not be
written to; write access and attempts to delete the file will then be
rejected.

<P><LI>The <B>"System"</B>
bit is usually only set for system files which are required for the operating
system to work. Write access and deletion will be rejected as well,
and the Desktop will not allow moving the file either.

<P><LI>The <B>"Hidden"</B> flag, finally, can be set in order to prevent
a file from being displayed in directory listings and folders. That is, the file
is not shown with the <CODE>DIR</CODE> command (unless the <CODE>/A</CODE> switch
is specified), and it will not be shown in folders (unless the folder has been
configured to display hidden files as well on the "Include" notebook page).
<P>Be warned though, if you set this flag from an object's properties notebook,
the file might be hidden from the folder and you might only be able to unset
this flag from the command line, using the
<A HREF="cmdref.inf#attrib"><CODE>ATTRIB</CODE></A> command.

</OL>You can view and set thes attributes from the Workplace Shell, either
by opening an object's
<A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A> or by opening
an object's <A HREF="glossary/gls_popmenu.html">&popmenu;</A>, which has
a "File attributes" submenu. Note that this only applies to file-system
objects.
