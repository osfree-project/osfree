"Advanced Power Management" (APM) is an industry standard for managing
computer power and energy consumption.

<P>Computers which comply to this standard are able to reduce power
consumption by switching into the "suspend" state. Besides, they do not
have to be switched off manually, but can turn off their own power.

<P>APM is especially useful on laptops. By using APM functions, applications
can query the current battery state of the system as well. For example,
the <A HREF="xcenter/xc_main.html">&xcenter;</A> has a
<A HREF="xcenter/xc_power.html">battery widget</A> that will show you
the current energy state of the laptop.

<P>To function correctly,
<UL><LI>APM must be supported by your computer's BIOS;
<P><LI>the &os2; <A HREF="cmdref.inf#apm.sys"><CODE>APM.SYS</CODE> device driver</A>
must be installed in the &cfgsys; file.
</UL>

Older systems only support the APM 1.1 level, which has certain limitations.
&os2; can support APM 1.2; however, for this to work, your computer's BIOS
must be able to support APM 1.2 as well.
