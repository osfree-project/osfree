<BODY>
Under almost all operating systems, every program runs in a
so-called <B>environment,</B> which is defined as a set of
<B>environment variables</B>. Each environment variable is
a key-value pair in the form of <CODE>KEY=VALUE</CODE>.

<P>The environment is used for several purposes:

<UL><LI>In many cases, it defines how the operating system
itself should act with respect to the program that is
running. For example, the
<A HREF="glossary/gls_path_sys.html">system paths</A> are
mostly defined as environment variables. You can therefore
change these paths before starting the program, thus affecting
where the operating system looks for files.

<P>These system environment variables are listed in the
<I>&os2; Command Reference</I>
(<A HREF="cmdref.inf"><CODE>CMDREF.INF</CODE></A>) and
are frequently already set at system startup via the
&cfgsys; file.

<P><LI>In addition, any program may by design react to specific
environment variables. To find out whether this is the case
and, if so, which variables are defined for a program, you
need to consult the application's documentation. &os2; does
not know about these requirements, it only provides the
infrastructure for setting and reading environment variables.

</UL>To read or set an environment variable at a comment prompt,
use the <A HREF="cmdref.inf#SET"><CODE>SET</CODE></A> command.

<P>You can specify environment variables by delimiting the variable
name to the left and right with a percent (<CODE>%</CODE>) sign.
This expression will by dynamically replaced by the command processor
with the value of the variable.

<P>For example, to add a new entry to the current list of directories
in the <A HREF="cmdref.inf#PATH"><CODE>PATH</CODE></A>
variable, you can type
<PRE>SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\NEWDIR</PRE>

<P>Using the <A HREF="cmdref.inf#SETLOCAL">SETLOCAL</A> command,
you can make a local copy of the environment space, the current
directory, and the current drive, to make temporary changes.
All these settings will be restored with the
<A HREF="cmdref.inf#ENDLOCAL"><CODE>ENDLOCAL</CODE></A> command.
