In order for two computers to communicate over a network, it
is not sufficient to just plug two machines together. In addition,
the computers need to agree on the "language" that is used for
communication. This language is called a <B>protocol</B>.

<P>In general, a protocol is a well-defined set of rules that two
computers must comply to in order to be able to exchange
information, most importantly, over a network. Since such a
rule set must be respected by all computers that take part in
the conversation, protocols are frequently described in an
industry or even international standard.

<P>&os2; supports many networking protocols, which can be set up
with the "Adapters and Protocols" object in the
<A HREF="objects/obj_setup_net.html">"Network Setup" folder</A>.

<P>The two most important protocols in use today are
&link_tcpip; and &link_netbios;, which allow you to
connect to both the &link_internet; and
<A HREF="glossary/gls_lan.html">Local Area Networks (LANs)</A>
with &os2;.

<P>For detailed information about networking protocols, refer to
the <A HREF="MPTSCFG.INF"><I>MPTS Configuration Guide</I></A>.
