<BODY>
The concept of paging allows &os2; to give
memory to applications even though no more physical memory
is available. This is sometimes referred to as "virtual memory"
(which should not be confused with the term "virtual address space"
-- see <A HREF="glossary/gls_mem_himem.html">&os2; Virtual Address Space</A> for more
on that).

<P>If paging is enabled, &os2; will temporarily
move data from physical RAM to a special swap file on a hard disk.
The &os2; swap file is always
called <CODE>SWAPPER.DAT</CODE>. Unless changed through
&cfgsys;, this file resides in the
<CODE>\OS2\SYSTEM</CODE> directory.

<P>In detail, the following happens:

<OL><LI>If an &os2; application allocates memory and not enough
physical memory is available, &os2; takes a chunk of the main
memory (RAM) which has not been accessed for a while and writes it
into <CODE>SWAPPER.DAT</CODE>. This part of memory is then
available and given to the requesting application.
As a result,
applications may use more memory than what is physically
installed in the computer.

<P><LI>Now, if some application accesses the memory chunk that
was swapped out,
&os2; intercepts this memory access (because that "memory"
now resides on the hard disk) and loads that region back into
memory from the hard disk before the application actually
accesses it. (If necessary, &os2; will have to swap another
memory region to the swap file first to make room for the
memory region which is to be loaded back into memory.)

</OL>Naturally, a hard disk is much slower than physical RAM,
typically by a ratio of 1:100, depending on your processor speed
and on whether that portion of memory has already been loaded
into the processor memory caches.

<P>This is why plenty of RAM is the most important prerequisite
for an acceptably fast &os2; installation. Even though you may
install &os2; with only 8 MB of RAM (&warp; 3 allegedly
even with 4), you will then only hear the hard disk rattle
because &os2; has to permanently swap in and out.

<P>Even if you have a relatively large amount of RAM installed
(say, 128 MB or more), &os2; may suddenly start swapping.
Since growing the swap file is an expensive operation, you
should choose your <CODE>SWAPPATH</CODE> settings carefully.

<P>If you are using the
<!-- V0.9.19: added link -->
<A HREF="xcenter/xc_main.html">&xcenter;</A>,
you can also use the
<A HREF="xcenter/xc_sentinel.html">"Sentinel" widget</A>
to monitor &os2;'s memory management.
