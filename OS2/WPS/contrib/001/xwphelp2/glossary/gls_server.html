<P>In a <A HREF="glossary/gls_lan.html">local area network (LAN)</A>,
a <B>server</B> is a computer that shares its resources with other computers,
the <B>clients.</B>

<P>Typically, with LANs, a server is a powerful computer with
extended operating system functionality specifically designed to handle
large amounts of network requests and multiple users, each with distinctive
access rights. The client computers then typically cannot share resources,
but only access the resources on the server.

<P>By contrast, in a peer network, every computer can act as a server or
client or both.

<P>Use the &link_wpnetgrp; to view all
servers that are currently sharing resources with the LAN.
