Dragging and dropping allows you to perform operations on an object when
more than one <A HREF="objects/obj_fdr_main.html">folder</A> is involved.
This is a quick way of copying or moving objects or creating
<A HREF="tasks/tsk_crshadow.html">shadows</A>.

<P>Within a single folder view, you can drag and drop objects to
arrange and reposition them.

<P>Perform the following:

<OL><LI>Place the mouse pointer over an object.

<P><LI>Press mouse button 2 and keep holding it down.

<P><LI>Move the mouse to the target of the operation while holding
down mouse button 2 all the time. The object moves around the screen with
the mouse pointer:

<P><IMG SRC="img/drag.gif">

<P>This is called <B>dragging</B> an object.

<P><LI>When the mouse pointer is over the target, release mouse button 2.
This is called <B>dropping</B> an object. The desired operation will be initiated.

</OL>Depending on the folders that are involved, if you do not hold down
any keys while performing the drag and drop, a default operation will
be performed. To enforce copy, move, or create shadow, hold down either
the <CODE>Shift</CODE> or <CODE>Ctrl</CODE> key or both. See
<A HREF="tasks/tsk_copymove.html">"Copy, move, and shadows overview"</A>
for details.

<P>If <A HREF="glossary/gls_select.html">several objects are selected</A>
and you begin dragging one of them, the operation will be performed on all of them
together.
