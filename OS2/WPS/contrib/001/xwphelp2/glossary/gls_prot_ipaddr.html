In any &link_tcpip; network, <B>IP adresses</B> are used to uniquely
identify computers. An IP adress is a 32-bit number, usually written
as four numbers from 0 to 255 such as <CODE>123.123.123.123</CODE>
(called the <B>dotted form</B> of an IP address).

<P>Within an isolated network, you can assign freely assign IP addresses
as long as each one is unique within the network. However, if the
network is connected to the &link_internet;, it is required
to use registered IP addresses to avoid duplicates.

<P>TCP/IP stores both the sender and the target IP adresses with
every packet that is sent over the network. Once the data has
arrived at the target, the recipient can see the IP address of the
sender and can respond by sending back data to the sender address
in a new connection, reversing the operation.

<P>Any IP address has two parts: a <B>network identifier</B> and the
identifier of a particular device within that network, the
<B>host identifier.</B>

<UL><LI>On the &link_internet;, the network identifier is assigned
globally by a Network Information Center (NIC). Since the Internet
is really a connection of many individual networks, each network
must know its own address and that of adjacent networks with which it
can communicate. While packages travel over the Internet, only
the network identifier is looked at by the computers that are
encountered on the way.

<P><LI>The <B>host identifier</B> identifies an individual computer
within a network. When a package has arrived at the target network,
it is then forwarded to that host.

</UL>Since networks vary greatly in size, there are four different
<B>IP adress classes</B>.
The first few bits of each IP address indicate which of the address
class formats it is using.

<UL><LI><B>Class A</B> addresses are for large networks with many devices.
These addresses have a top bit of <CODE>0</CODE>, then 7 bits for the
network address, and 24 bits for the host address. As a result, there
can only be 127 class A networks on the Internet.

<P>In dotted form, these addresses break down into
<CODE>network.local.local.local</CODE>.

<P><LI><B>Class B</B> addresses are for medium-sized networks. They have
the two top bits set to <CODE>10</CODE>, then 14 bits for the
network address, and 16 bits for the host address.

<P>In dotted form, these addresses break down into
<CODE>network.network.local.local</CODE>.

<P><LI><B>Class C</B> addresses are for small networks with up to 255
devices. They have the top three bits set to <CODE>110</CODE>, then
21 bits for the network address, and only 8 bits for the host.

<P>In dotted form, these addresses break down into
<CODE>network.network.network.local</CODE>.

</UL>As you can see, even though a 32-bit IP address could theoretically
allow for a giant number of computer identifiers, the above scheme
limits the number of addresses that can practically be assigned. The
large majority of networks are class C networks and will suffer from
the "255 hosts" restrictions. As a result, many networks use techniques
to economize on the number of IP addresses that are actually visible
to the rest of the Internet. These techniques include
subnets, IP forwarding, and Classless Inter-Domain Routing.

<P>Most importantly, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) will assign
<B>dynamic IPs</B> every time a user connects to the Internet. This
allows the ISP to reuse addresses from its pool of addresses instead
of having to assign each customer a static ID. As a result, your computer's
IP address will vary from time to time every time you connect to the
Internet.
