Wildcards are a greatly simplified variant of UNIX-style
<A HREF="glossary/gls_regexps.html">regular expressions</A>.
They allow for matching several file names with one character string
and are most frequently used on the DOS and &os2; command lines.

<P>&os2; understands two wildcard characters:

<OL><LI>The <B>asterisk</B> (<CODE>*</CODE>) character matches any sequence
of characters (no character, one character, or many characters).

<P>For example, <CODE>h*e</CODE> will match <CODE>he</CODE>,
<CODE>house</CODE>, and <CODE>home</CODE>.

<P><LI>The <B>question mark</B> (<CODE>?</CODE>) matches exactly one character.

<P>For example, <CODE>h??e</CODE> will match <CODE>home</CODE>, but
not <CODE>he</CODE> or <CODE>house</CODE>.

</OL>Wildcards can also be combined. For example, <CODE>h*e.?x?</CODE>
will match <CODE>house.txt</CODE> and <CODE>he.exe</CODE>

<P>Note that as opposed to DOS, under &os2; the dot (<CODE>.</CODE>)
in file names is a special character only with
files on the <A HREF="glossary/gls_fs.html">FAT</A> file system.
