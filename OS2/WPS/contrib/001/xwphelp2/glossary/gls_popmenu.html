In the Workplace Shell, every object has associated with it a &popmenu;
that displays the options that are currently available for an object.

<P>To <B>open the &popmenu;</B> of any object, move the mouse pointer over it
and press mouse button 2. A menu will open with several options in it.

<P>Exacly <I>what</I> options are displayed will vary depending on the object.
The &popmenu; only displays options that can <I>presently</I> be used with the
object. For example, objects that cannot be deleted will not have the
"Delete" menu item. As another example, &link_folders;
usually have a lot more menu items than other objects.

<P>The &popmenu; can also be used to open an object's
<A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>
by selecting the "Properties" menu item:

<P><IMG SRC="img/properties.gif">

<P>In addition, you can select to open a specific view from the object's
"Open" submenu. This is helpful for folders, for example, to have a
view opened that is different from the default view that gets opened
when you double-click on the folder.
