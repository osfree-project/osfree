<P>Windowed sessions have specific functions available that you can select
from the system menu that is opened when you click on the title-bar
icon of the window. Alternatively, click on the window with mouse button 2
to open a &popmenu;. Additional help is available for each menu choice.

<P>With the menu, you can
<UL>
<LI>change the <B>font size</B> of the characters that are displayed
in the active window;
<LI>turn <B>scrolling</B> on or off;
<LI><B>mark</B> text or graphics in the window for copying
to the &os2; <A HREF="glossary/gls_clipboard.html">clipboard</A>;
<LI><B>copy</B> text or graphics that were marked from the window
to the &os2; clipboard;
<LI><B>copy all</B> text or graphics from the active window to
the &os2; clipboard;
<LI><B>paste</B> all text or graphics from the &os2; clipboard
into the active window.
</UL>

<B>Note:</B> You must use full screen instead of a
window when a program

<UL><LI>needs access to the physical screen selector,
<LI>directly works with the display adapter instead of using &os2;'s display
drivers,
<LI>uses the &os2; monitor facility, or
<LI>attempts to register replacements for the Vio, Kbd, or Mou subsystems of the
operating system.
