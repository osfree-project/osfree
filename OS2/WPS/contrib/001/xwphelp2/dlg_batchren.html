<BODY>
The "Rename objects" menu item allows you to rename many objects at once,
using <A HREF="glossary/gls_regexps.html">extended regular expressions</A>
("batch renaming").
Note that simple <A HREF="glossary/gls_wildcards.html">wildcard</A>
expressions are not supported in this dialog.

<P>Batch renaming can be very useful if you have to rename many objects at
once according to the same criteria -- for example, if you would like to
rename all files ending in <CODE>.JPEG</CODE> to <CODE>.jpg</CODE>.

<P>To do a batch rename, do the following:

<!-- V0.9.20: replace UL with OL tag and /UL with /OL -->
<OL><LI>Enter a <B>"find" regular expression</B> in the top entry field. This
is the match string against with objects will be tested according to
the rules specified under
<A HREF="glossary/gls_regexps.html">extended regular expressions</A>.

<P>For example, if you specify <CODE>(.*)\.JPEG</CODE> here, all files
ending in <CODE>.JPEG</CODE> will be affected by the rename.

<P>Make sure that each string component that you would like to replace with
a different string is specified in brackets. Otherwise you cannot reference
the component from the "rename to" expression.

<P><LI>Enter a <B>"rename to" expression</B> into the second entry field.
This specifies the rule according to
which each object is renamed.

<P>Note that the replacement string is not a full regular expression because
it is not used for matching objects. As a result, you do not have to escape
special characters such as dots. However, a backslash with a decimal number
specifies is considered a reference into a bracket expression in the search
string.

<P>With the above example, to rename the files
ending in <CODE>.JPEG</CODE> to <CODE>.jpg</CODE>, specify
<CODE>\1.jpg</CODE>. With an object called <CODE>FILE.JPEG</CODE>
matched against the <CODE>(.*)\.JPEG</CODE> find string, <CODE>\1</CODE>
in the object title would yield <CODE>FILE</CODE>, so the object would be
renamed to <CODE>FILE.jpg</CODE>.

<P><LI>Select or deselect the <B>"Case sensitive match"</B> box, depending on
whether the search string should be applied irrespective of case.

<P><LI>If you select <B>"Match selected objects only"</B>, the find operation
will only apply to objects that are currently selected in the folder. Otherwise
all objects in the folder will be tested against the "find" string.

<P><LI>Press the <B>"Start renaming..."</B> button. This will then ask
you for each object that matches the source string and give you the
proposed title for renaming it so you can verify whether the strings
you entered actually do what you were intending to achieve.

</OL>The dialog maintains a history of the last ten valid source and
target regular expressions, respectively. You can access this history
by accessing the drop-down list for each entry field.
