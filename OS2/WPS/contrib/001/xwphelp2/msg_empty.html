&xwp; displays this message when you select the "[Empty]" item
in a submenu. This menu item appears only when you have put a subfolder into the
&cfgfdr; which does not contain any valid objects.

<P><B>Remedy:</B>

<P>Put Desktop objects into the corresponding subfolder of the &cfgfdr;.
The corresponding subfolder carries the same name as the submenu you have opened.
