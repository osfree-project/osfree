<BODY>
The font object sample view shows you a sample string in various sizes to allow
you to test what the font looks like without having to select it into an application.

<P>In addition, the font sample view can display a graphical representation of
some of the <B>font metrics.</B> Font metrics are specified by the font's designer
to give additional information about spacings and sizes to the font rendering engine.

<!-- V0.9.20: added links -->
<P>(For programmers: With &os2;, font metrics are contained in a
<A HREF="pmref.inf#fontmetrics"><CODE>FONTMETRICS</CODE></A>
structure, which is described in the <I>PM Programming Reference.</I><A HREF="_toolkitlink.html">*</A>)

<P>Font metrics have been added to the &xwp; font sample view to allow
you to find out whether maybe a font file is broken. In addition, this might
help programmers to find out what all the misnamed fields in &os2;'s
<CODE>FONTMETRICS</CODE> structure really represent.

<P>You can select the metrics to be displayed from an open sample view's
<!-- V0.9.19: link added -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_popmenu.html">&popmenu;</A>.

<P>If you find all this confusing, simply disable all font metrics display
and never use it again.
Otherwise see <A HREF="font_view2.html">"Font metrics"</A> for details.
