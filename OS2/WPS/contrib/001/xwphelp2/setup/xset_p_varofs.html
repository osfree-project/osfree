        &xwp; Menu Item ID Offset
    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
With this number you can tell &xwp; which menu IDs will be used
for the menu items inserted by &xwp;. Change this number if
&xwp; seems to conflict with other WPS software which also
inserts menu items into &popmenu;s.
<P>This setting takes effect immediately.
<P><B>Detailed explanation:</B>
<P>With &os2;, each menu item (be it a submenu or a "real" menu item) needs a
unique menu ID within the menu. This is a number from 0 to 0xFFFF, identifying
the menu item to the system, so that the "owner" of the menu can react when a
menu item is pressed.
<P>IBM recommends that every WPS developer use a number higher
than WPMENUID_USER (which, on Warp 3 and 4,
is 0x6500) for &popmenu; additions.
<P>Early versions of XFolder always used WPMENUID_USER+100
(dec) and above for the variable menu items, but this
has conflicted with other software.
Since &xwp; has no way to find out which offset other
WPS sofware might use, this setting is now
configurable; &xwp; will now use menu items with at least WPMENUID_USER
plus the number you specified here.
