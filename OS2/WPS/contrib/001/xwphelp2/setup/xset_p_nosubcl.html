<!-- Changes in this file:
     V0.81:
        -- Updated the list below which &xwp; items don't work
           without subclassing.
     V0.9.0: see notes below
-->
With this setting you can tell &xwp; not to subclass any folders.
<P><B>Important note:</B> Many of &xwp;'s features RELY on folder subclassing.
Enabling this setting will severely limit &xwp;'s capabilities. This setting is only
meant to be a "last resort" in case &xwp; does not work properly on your system.
<P>Enabling this setting will automatically disable the following &xwp; features:
<UL><LI>Folder hotkeys;
<BR><LI>Auto-scroll Tree views;
<BR><LI>the
<!-- V0.9.19: link added -->
<A HREF="menus/menu_content.html">folder content menus</A>;
<BR><LI>folder status bars;
<BR><LI>folder and menu system sounds.

</UL>Only folders which are opened after changing this setting will be affected.
<!-- V0.9.0: added the following phrase -->
That is, subclassing of folders which are currently open will not be undone.
Especially the Desktop (which is a folder too) will not be affected. If you
experience severe problems with &xwp;, you will have to reboot or restart the WPS.

<P><B>Detailed explanation:</B>

<P>As you might know, in &os2; (and Windows too), windows communicate with "messages"
to notify each other of certain events.
The base operating system also uses messages to notify windows of certain events. For
example, every time you move or click the mouse or press a key, a window receives a
notification message so it can react to it.
<P>Now, "subclassing" is a very powerful feature of &os2;. It allows a program to intercept
messages for a certain window or window class and thus make window react differently.
&xwp; uses this feature all over the place, for example to intercept keyboard
messages for folders. This is the way the folder hotkeys work: when &xwp; has
intercepted a keyboard message and finds out that a hotkey has been defined for that
key, the respective folder action is executed.
<!-- V0.9.0: rewritten the following -->
<P>Subclassing might lead to problems, however, if several programs try to subclass
a window and do not know of each other. For example, the WPS uses subclassing
intensively itself (which is not very well documented), and WPS enhancers other
than &xwp; (e.g. Object Desktop) implement some of their features this way too.
Unfortunately, there is no general "registry" which could offer information about
which software has subclassed which windows, so &xwp; has no way to find out
what other programs have done.
<P>
So if you feel that  something is going wrong, you can tell &xwp; to leave folder
windows alone.
