        Beep on Priority Change
    </TITLE>

<BODY>
This setting issues a beep over the system speaker whenever &xwp; changes
the Worker thread's priority.
<P>
Normally, the Worker thread runs with the priority you specify with the
<A HREF="setup/xset_p_prty.html">"Default Worker thread priority"</A> setting.
However, when &xwp; finds out that the Worker thread cannot keep up with
all the data that comes in, its priority is automatically raised temporarily.
To be notified of these changes, you can enable this setting.
<P>
On most computers however, these priority changes will not occur frequently,
unless you populate folders with a <I>lot</I> of objects, because then
the Worker thread gets a stack of objects to remember at the same time.
