        Disable Undocumented Menu Functions

<!-- This is all new with V0.9.6. -->
If this item is checked, some of the menu hacks in &xwp; are turned off.
&xwp; had to use some undocumented tricks to get certain things to work.

<P>Enable this item <I>only</I> if you run into problems with some of the WPS menu
functions that &xwp; introduces. This might solve some problems, but introduce more.

<P>Maybe among others, enabling this setting will disable the following:

<UL><LI>Collecting objects from a container when a &popmenu; is opened.
This will probably break
retrieving correct icons for file operations such as "delete" and "move to trash can",
if these features are enabled on the "Features" page.

<P><LI>
<!-- V0.9.19: link added -->
<A HREF="menus/menu_content.html">Folder content menus</A>.

<P><LI>Menu system sounds.

<P><LI>Manipulation of Warp 4 folder menu bars.

<P><LI>Menus will close with all of the items in the "View" submenu which normally
keep the menu open.
