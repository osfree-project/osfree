The <B>"Language"</B> groups displays some information about the National
Language Support (NLS) which has been installed for &xwp;.
With the "Language" drop-down box you can change &xwp;'s language, if several
&xwp; NLS packages are installed on your system.
Changing this setting will immediately affect the &xwp; dialogs, notebook pages,
some menu  entries, and the &xwp; message boxes. A reboot is not required.
It will, of course, not affect the &popmenu; entries which correspond
to the objects in the &cfgfdr;.

<P>The drop-down box contains all the National Language Support
<!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_dll.html">DLLs</A>
that &xwp; could find in its own directories. All these DLLs are named
<CODE>"XFLDRxxx.DLL"</CODE>, with "xxx" being a three-digit country code.
For example, English is "001".
See the <A HREF="cmdref.inf#country">&os2; Command Reference</A> for a list of
country codes.
