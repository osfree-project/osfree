Select "Refresh now" to make sure the
<A HREF="objects/obj_fdr_views.html">folder view</A> is up to date.

<P>This will rescan the directory that corresponds to the folder,
if necessary, to make sure the objects in the folder reflect
the current file-system information. This operation might take a
few seconds to finish.
In addition, this completely repaints the folder view window.

<P>Remarks:

<OL><LI>By default, &xwp; also defines the <B>F5</B> folder
hotkey as a shortcut to the "Refresh now" function.

<P><LI>You can control the automatic refresh of folder views
on the "Folder views" page in the
&link_wpsobj;.
