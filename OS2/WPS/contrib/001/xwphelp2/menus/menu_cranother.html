The items in the <B>"Create another"</B> menu will create a new object
of the same type as the currently selected object. However, the current
object will not be copied. Instead, a new object of the same type,
but with <I>default</I> properties and data will be created.

<P>The "Create another" menu has a default menu choice.
Only if you select the arrow to the right of "Create another", a submenu
is displayed. This menu contains a listing of all the
<A HREF="tasks/tsk_templates.html">templates</A>
on the system which are of the same type as the current object. However,
even though all of these templates are of the same type, they might have
properties and data that are different from the current object.

<P>The result of using "Create another" is identical to
creating an object from a template.

<P><B>Note:</B> The "Create another" menu lists objects of the same
type as the current object. By contrast, the <B>"Create new"</B> menu always
contains the same list of templates, which is taken from the
&xwp; <A HREF="objects/obj_cfgfdr.html">&cfgfdr;</A>.
By default, frequently used object types such as folders are in
that menu, but you can change that list yourself.
