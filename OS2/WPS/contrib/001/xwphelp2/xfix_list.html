        xfix: The Handles List
    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.7 -->
<BODY>
On startup, xfix loads the handles table from the active
<CODE>PM_Workplace:HandlesX</CODE> section in <CODE>OS2SYS.INI</CODE>.
(See <A HREF="xfix_handles.html">About WPS file handles</A> for details.)

<P>xfix then parses the handles table.
For each handle that was parsed by xfix, the following information is displayed
in the columns of the xfix handles list:

<OL><LI><B>"i"</B> is just a count which is raised with each handle that was
parsed. This number is not present in <CODE>OS2SYS.INI</CODE> and is not
updated when you delete handles.
(See "Sort by index" in the <A HREF="xfix_menus.html">Menu commands reference</A>.)

<P><LI>The second column shows you the <B>status</B> of each handle. This is
assigned by xfix. If xfix considers the handle to be OK, this column is empty.

<P>Already after startup, xfix checks the handles for integrity. It will detect
invalid parent handles and duplicate handles immediately. If you want to have
file handles marked invalid which no longer point to valid file-system information,
you must first issue "Find invalid files" from the
<A HREF="xfix_menus.html">"Actions" menu</A>.

<P>Every handle entry that has anything in this column is given a gray emphasis
so that you can quickly see it. If you use "Select all invalid" from the
<A HREF="xfix_menus.html">"Select" menu</A>, all those items are automatically
selected for you.

<P><LI>The <B>"Type"</B> field is either <CODE>NODE</CODE> or <CODE>DRIV</CODE>.
If you <A HREF="xfix_menus.html">sort by index</A> to get the original
order of items as in <CODE>OS2SYS.INI</CODE>, you will see that there will always
be a <CODE>DRIV</CODE> entry before all <CODE>NODE</CODE> entries
which belong to that drive.
In addition, there is always an extra <CODE>NODE</CODE> entry for the root directory
after the <CODE>DRIV</CODE> node, if any handles exist for that drive. I don't
know why there is an extra <CODE>DRIV</CODE> node, but I guess the WPS uses it
as a marker internally for finding handles more quickly.

<P><LI>The <B>"Node ofs"</B> field displays the offset at which this entry (the
"node") was found in the handles table from <CODE>OS2SYS.INI</CODE>. The table
starts with four maintenance bytes (whose meaning is unknown to me), so the
first entry always starts at offset 4. The length of each entry depends on its
short name (see below).

<P><LI>The <B>"Handle"</B> field is from the node in <CODE>OS2SYS.INI</CODE> and
shows you the file system handle in hexadecimal,
which becomes the low-word of the object handle of the corresponding filesystem
object (WPDataFile or WPFolder).
See <A HREF="xfix_handles.html">About WPS file handles</A> for details.

<P>There is no obvious rule for how handles are assigned. It appears that when
new handles are created, they are just given a random number which is not used yet.

<P>This field is empty for <CODE>DRIV</CODE> entries because these never have
handles. Again, obviously, <CODE>DRIV</CODE> nodes are just markers in the
handles data.

<P><LI>The <B>"Parent"</B> field is also stored with the entry in <CODE>OS2SYS.INI</CODE>
and specifies the handle of the folder in which this object (either a file or another
folder) resides.
This better be valid (except for root <CODE>NODE</CODE> entries, where
this is 0, obviously). If it is not, xfix marks the entry as "Orphaned" and
invalid because it is no longer useful.

<P>The parent handle is of great importance. The WPS cannot build the full
<!-- V0.9.20: link added -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_path.html">path</A>
from a file handle if a parent handle is not valid. See below for how
this works.

<P><LI>The <B>"Short name"</B> is stored in the handles block and specifies the
name of the file-system object without the full path path specification. The
length of the file name is variable and is also the reason why each entry has
a different size.

<P>Normally, the WPS upper-cases the short names. However, on my system, some
entries are in mixed case as well. I have no idea whether this causes any
problems.

<P><LI>The <B>"Children"</B> field is calculated by xfix while it is parsing
the handles table. It specifies how many other entries rely on this entry
because it is specified as their parent handle, either directly (as seen in
the "Parent" field) or indirectly (because other parents are in between).

<P>If "Children" is 0, you can delete this entry without hurting other
entries. (This still doesn't imply that it's always safe to delete the entry,
since this might break shadows etc. See
<A HREF="xfix_delete.html">Deleting file handles</A>.)

<P><LI>The <B>"Dups"</B> field is also set up by xfix and counts the number of
duplicates of each handle. <B>This had better be zero for each handle.</B>
If it is not, the WPS will probably blow up pretty soon. That's why xfix
then gives the handle the "Duplicate" status and marks it as invalid.

<P>See <A HREF="xfix_howto.html">How can I...</A> for more on duplicates.

<P><LI>The <B>"Refcs."</B> field stands for "References" and tells you whether
this handle is currently used from the <CODE>OS2.INI</CODE> file.

<P>If you see <CODE>ABS</CODE> in this field, this means the handle is listed in
the <CODE>PM_Abstract:FldrContent</CODE> section of <CODE>OS2.INI</CODE>. That
section lists the abstract objects that are present in a folder. In other words,
if you see <CODE>ABS</CODE>, the handle is for a folder which contains abstract
objects.

<P>If you see <CODE>FPOS</CODE> in this field, this means the handle is listed
in the <CODE>PM_Workplace:FolderPos</CODE> section. That section lists all the
folder positions that were ever stored by the WPS. So if you see <CODE>FPOS</CODE>,
the entry is for a folder which has already been opened by the WPS and has had
its folder position stored.

<P>See <A HREF="xfix_delete.html">Deleting file handles</A> for implications when
deleting file handles which have these fields set.

<P><LI>The <B>"Long name"</B> shows you the full path specification of this
handle, as it would be resolved by the WPS. Note that this does not appear
in the handle entry in <CODE>OS2SYS.INI</CODE>... instead, this displays
the smartness of the whole file handles concept.

<P>The way this works is that when the WPS needs a full file name from an object
handle (e.g. when a program object is started and the executable name is
needed), it looks up the object's handle in the table, which
gives it the short name (as displayed in the "Short name" column).

<P>The WPS then looks at the parent handle of this entry. It looks up the entry
for the parent handle and prepends the short file name of the parent to the
current entry. It then goes for the parent's parent... and so on, until the
root node for the drive is reached. (At least this is how xfix builds the
long file name.)

<P>This has several advantages:

<BR><UL><LI>Only the short name has to be stored in <CODE>OS2SYS.INI</CODE>, which
saves space.

<P><LI>Even more importantly though, this is very efficient when files or folders
are moved. In that case, only the parent handle of the object being moved has to
be updated. Since all sub-objects of the item being moved only contain a parent
handle, the next time the full file name is needed, it can be correctly built with
the new path.

<P>This is why program objects still work after folders have been moved.
