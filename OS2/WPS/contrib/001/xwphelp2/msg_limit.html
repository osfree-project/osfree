<BODY>
&xwp; displays this message when too many menu items were inserted into &popmenu;s.
This message is a warning only and should have no further consequences. It appears when
you browse through &popmenu;s too extensively without ever closing the &popmenu;
at all.
<P><B>Remedy:</B>
<P>Simply close the &popmenu; from time to time by clicking somewhere on the Desktop.
<P><B>Detailed explanation:</B>
&os2; does not provide an unlimited number of menu items for submenus. Every menu item
must be assiged an internal identification number (ID) to. For these IDs,
&xwp; uses
0x6500 (decimal 25856) plus the number you specified as an "offset" in the
Global Settings,
and assigns a new ID to every single item which appears in the &popmenu;s. However,
&os2; begins to behave in an unpredictable way if menu IDs larger than 0x8000 (decimal
32768) are used, so &xwp; aborts menu processing as soon as this limit is reached.
Upon opening the next &popmenu;, counting starts again from the beginning, so this
error should not have any consequences.
