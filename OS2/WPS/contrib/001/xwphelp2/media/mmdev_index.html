The "Index" column shows you the index of each device within its
device type group.

<P>Normally this will be "1" for each device. However, if you have multiple
devices of a certain type, each such device will receive a unique index.

<P>For example, if you have two CD-ROM drives, they will receive the indices
"1" and "2", respectively.

<P>Note that if you have IBM's Netscape Plug-in Pack with MPEG support installed,
the MPEG support is installed as a second digital video device as well for some
reason.
