The "Drivers" column shows you detailed data about the drivers that implement
the device.

<P>Depending on the type of the device, the following information may be shown:

<UL><LI><B>Media control driver:</B> The MCD is responsible for interpreting
multimedia commands that are sent from an application to a device. It is up
to the MCD to take further action depending on the command that was sent.
The name listed here will correspond to a
<!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_dll.html">DLL</A>
in the MMOS2 directory.

<P><LI><B>Vendor-specific driver:</B> If installed, the VSD usually gets called
from the MCD for implementing functions for a certain hardware. This architecture
allows MMPM/2 to keep the MCD's fairly generic, while the hardware-specific
code will usually be in the VSD.

<P>For example, the "waveaudio" devices are usually implemented by a generic
MCD, while the actual work on the sound card is done in a VSD (which will in
turn communicate with a device driver).

<P><LI><B>Physical device driver:</B> The PDD is responsible for actually working
on the hardware. Since this has to be done at ring 0, especially if interrupts
need to be processed, this layer is necessary.

<P>Not all devices will need a PDD. Typically this is the case for sound cards,
which need to handle interrupts and DMA.

<P><LI><B>Parameters:</B> these are additional parameters from the ASCII
<CODE>MMPM2.INI</CODE> file in your MMOS2 directory that were specified for
the device. This is device-specific, but appears to be related to what was
specified for a device in the "Multimedia Setup" object.
