<!-- V0.9.19: title changed -->
<BODY>
If this setting is enabled, &xshutdown; will attempt to automatically switch off your
computer after shutdown has completed, instead of displaying the usual message
that you may now switch off your computer.

<!-- V0.9.7: changed all the following. -->
<P>This will only work if your computer supports this. For this, both your BIOS and
&os2; must support at least
<!-- V0.9.19: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_apm.html">APM V1.1</A>,
<!-- V1.0.5: added ACPI -->
or you must have installed ACPI support.
The APM and ACPI levels of your system are displayed on the shutdown notebook page for
your convenience.

<P>If the <B>"Delay"</B> setting is also enabled, &xshutdown; will wait three seconds
before actually issuing the power-off request to the <CODE>APM.SYS</CODE> driver or
ACPI subsystem.
This might help on a few systems where the power was switched off before all the
caches were flushed. If you get CHKDSK's after using power-off, you might want
to try enabling this setting.
