In the <B>confirmation window</B>
<IFNDEF __NOXSHUTDOWN__>
(which is displayed if you have enabled
confirmations in the Desktop's
<A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>)
</IFNDEF>
the following settings are available:

<UL><LI>You may determine whether &xwp; should <B>close all sessions</B> before
restarting the WPS. If so, &xwp; will not only close the WPS windows, but all
other programs also.

<IFNDEF __NOXWPSTARTUP__>
<P><LI>You may also determine whether after the Desktop restart &xwp; should
<B>process all startup folders</B> again. If this is enabled, &xwp; will
process <I>all</I> &xwp; startup folders after the Desktop restart. By contrast,
if this setting is disabled, only those startup folders will be processed which
have the "Every Desktop restart" setting enabled in their respective
<A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>.

<P><B>Note:</B> You should only enable this setting
if you have either "Close all sessions" enabled also or if you're sure that
the programs in the startup folder are not currently running, because otherwise
they might be started twice.

<P>This setting does not affect the regular &os2; startup folder. That folder is
never processed after a Desktop restart.
</IFNDEF>

<P><LI>If you select <B>"Archive desktop once after restart",</B> &xwp; will
enable the "Archiving" feature once before the restart and disable it again
after the Desktop has restarted. This is just a shortcut to manually enabling
the archiving settings in the Desktop's
<A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A> and then disabling
them again.

<!-- V1.0.0: added ifndef -->
<IFNDEF __EASYSHUTDOWN__>
<P><LI>If you deselect the <B>"Show this message next time"</B> setting,
confirmations will be disabled for eXtended Shutdown and Desktop restarts.
You can then re-enable the confirmations in the Desktop's
<A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A> on
the "&xshutdown;" page.
