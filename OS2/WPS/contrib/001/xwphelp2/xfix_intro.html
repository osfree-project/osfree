This is xfix, the &xwp; File Handles Fixer.

<P>What xfix can do for you:

<UL><LI>Dump the contents of the WPS's file handle data blocks from the
<CODE>OS2SYS.INI</CODE> files into a PM container. This is what you are
seeing now.

<P><LI>Allow you to remove each handle individually.

<P><LI>Allow you to remove folder position entries which have been wrongly assigned.

<P><LI>Move lost abstract objects to the Desktop.

</UL>Compared to Henk Kelder's formidable CHECKINI program (from the
<A HREF="http://www.os2site.com/sw/util/wps/wptools33.zip">WPTOOLS</A> package),
xfix gives you more control, but also requires more attention and knowledge.

<P>Thanks go out to Henk Kelder again for finding out how the handles work in the
first place. xfix is partly based on his work.

<P><B>Warning:</B> This program allows you to even remove file handles that the
WPS relies on, such as the handles for the Desktop. xfix will allow you to make
any changes to the file handles without preventing changes that should not be
made. <B>Only use this program if you know what you're doing. Read through all
the following before using this.</B>

<P>In general, you are safe until you select
"Write back to OS2SYS.INI" from the "xfix" menu. Only this will actually
modify your system.
