        &xcenter;: Reduce Desktop Workarea

<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.7 -->
<BODY>
If <B>"Reduce Desktop workarea"</B> is enabled,
the PM desktop's workarea will be reduced by the size of this &xcenter;.

<P>Enabling this setting for any &xcenter; will have the effect that maximized windows
will not be maximized to the full size of the screen anymore, but only to
the screen size minus all open &xcenter;s that have this setting enabled.

<P>This is equivalent to &warpcenter;'s
"Put on top of maximized windows" setting, whose name isn't really that
correct.

<P>This cannot be used together with <A HREF="xcenter/xc_v_hide.html">"auto-hide"</A>.

<P><B>Notes:</B>

<!-- V0.9.19: added ifndef -->
<IFNDEF __EWORKPLACE__>
<LI>This probably doesn't work on Warp 3.
<P>
</IFNDEF>

<LI>This setting is global and will affect the entire system.
It can lead to the same problems as with &warpcenter;'s setting (most notably
scroll bars on the WPS Desktop), so use this with care.

<P><LI> Do not use this setting on the &xcenter; if you have the
corresponding &warpcenter; setting enabled also. The &xcenter; cannot check for
whether the &warpcenter; has this enabled as well, and this will probably lead
to problems.
