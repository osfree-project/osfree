The <B>"View thread priority"</B> allows you to specify the priority delta
of the thread that is started when the &xcenter; is opened.
See <A HREF="glossary/gls_scheduler.html">"Processes and threads"</A> for
more information about thread priorities.

<P>The &xcenter; does not run on the same thread as most other WPS windows
-- which is normally thread 1 in the WPS process. Instead, when an &xcenter;
is opened, a new thread is created. This allows you to set the priority
of the &xcenter; independently from the rest of the WPS.

<P>By default, the &xcenter; runs with a priority delta of zero, which is
the standard priority delta (and the same as all other WPS windows).
However, you can raise that delta up to 31 (which is the maximum priority
delta in &os2;) to give the &xcenter; precendence over other tasks in the system.
Among other things, this might make animations run more smoothly.

<P>Notes:

<UL><LI>The &xcenter; will always use the "regular" priority class to avoid
system hangs and side effects with other software. Only within that class you
may alter the priority delta between zero and 31. (In other words, the
&xcenter; will not allow you to use a time-critical or foreground server
priority.)

<P><LI>Some <A HREF="xcenter/xc_main_widgets.html">widgets</A> may use
additional threads for their own purposes, which are not affected by this
setting. For example, the <A HREF="xcenter/xc_pulse.html">Pulse widget</A>
starts a second thread to collect the CPU load from the &os2; kernel to
ensure the data is accurate even under high system loads.

<P><LI>If some process is blocking the system, for example by not processing
its message queue, this setting has little effect on that problem.
