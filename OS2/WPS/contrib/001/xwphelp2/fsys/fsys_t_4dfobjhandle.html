<BODY>
The <B>"Pass Data File Object Handle in Environment"</B> setting determines
how &xwp; will set the <CODE>WP_OBJHANDLE</CODE> variable in the environment
of a program that was started via a data file association. Disabling this
setting allows you to reduce the number of file-system
<A HREF="glossary/gls_objhandle.html">object handles</A> that are created on
your system.

<UL><LI>If the setting is <B>checked</B>, if you start a program via a
data file association, the data file's
<A HREF="glossary/gls_objhandle.html">object handle</A> will also be passed
in the environment. <CODE>WP_OBJHANDLE</CODE> will then be set as follows:

<P><CODE>WP_OBJHANDLE=<I>program</I>,<I>datafile</I></CODE>

<P>where <CODE><I>program</I></CODE> is the object handle of the program object
or program file that was started and <CODE><I>datafile</I></CODE> is the object
handle of the data file whose association caused the program to start.

<P>This is the default Workplace Shell behavior.

<P><LI>If the setting is <B>unchecked</B>, <CODE>WP_OBJHANDLE</CODE> will be
set as follows:

<P><CODE>WP_OBJHANDLE=<I>program</I></CODE>

<P>In other words, the data file handle will <I>not</I> be passed.

</UL>This setting was added because every time a data file is started, for example
when you double-click on a data file, an object handle has to be created for the
file, which will remain in the <CODE>OS2SYS.INI</CODE> file forever, even if it
is never used again. Over time, this can create a lot of handles. You can thus
now turn the setting off, and you will find that your handles section in
<CODE>OS2SYS.INI</CODE> will no longer grow as fast.

<P>However, some applications might rely on the default Workplace Shell behavior.
If you turn the setting off and an application no longer works, you will have to
keep the setting enabled.

<P>The setting takes effect immediately.
