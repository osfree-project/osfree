On this notebook page you can configure some view settings individually
for every folder. This allows you to override some of the global settings specified
in the <!-- V0.9.4: link added -->
<A HREF="objects/obj_wps.html">"Workplace Shell" object.</A>
Initially, the settings will be
the same as with the global settings; if you change anything here, this will
be remembered for this folder only, and changes to the global settings will not affect
this folder any more.
<P>Changing the settings will take effect immediately.
<UL><LI>If a setting is <B>checked,</B> the respective setting will
always be enabled for this folder, no matter what you specify in the
global settings.
<BR><LI>Reversely, if a setting is <B>unchecked,</B> the respective
setting will always be disabled for this folder.

</UL>Press <B>"Undo"</B> to restore the settings
that were in use before you opened this notebook page.
<P>Press <B>"Default"</B> to make this folder behave according to the
global settings in the <!-- V0.9.4: link added -->
<A HREF="objects/obj_wps.html">"Workplace Shell" object.</A>
This will remove the data which was remembered for this folder.
