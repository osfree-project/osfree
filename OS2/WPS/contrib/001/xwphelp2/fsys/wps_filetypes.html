The "File types" page allows you to configure the new, extended &xwp; file
types, their file filters, and their associated program objects.

<!-- V0.9.9: changed this -->
<P>See <A HREF="glossary/gls_assocs.html">Types and associations</A> for an
introduction to associations between data files and programs.

<P>The page consists of three containers, allowing you to freely configure
the file types.

<!-- V0.9.4: removed all the following and replaced it with these links -->
<P>For a detailed explanation of each field, select from the list below:

<!-- V0.9.20: added this link -->
