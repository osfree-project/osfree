The <B>"Filters"</B> container on the top right displays the filters
that have been defined for the file type that is currently selected
on the left.

<P>Note that the &xwp; file filters are <I>not</I> related to the default
WPS file filters, which have no meaning here and cannot be modified using this page.
If extended file types are enabled, &xwp; will completely ignore the standard
WPS file filters.

<P>While the WPS file filters were used to assign a <I>program</I> to a data file,
&xwp; uses file filters to assign a <I>file type</I> to a data file.
For example, if you define "*.htm" as a filter for the "HTML" file type, all your
files ending in "*.htm" will automatically get the HTML file type (and the
associations defined for that type).

<P>&xwp; allows you to <B>import the WPS filters</B> though to make them
work with the extended file associations. Right-click into the "Filters"
container and select "Import WPS filters".
