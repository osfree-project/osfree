This notebook page allows you to fine-tune the behavior of the &xwp; trash can.
<!-- V0.9.16: Please see the <I>&xwp; User Guide</I> for an introduction to what
the &xwp; trash can does. -->
<P>Press <B>"Undo"</B> to restore the settings
that were in use before you opened this notebook page.
<P>Press <B>"Default"</B> to restore the settings
to the installation state.

<!-- V0.9.4: removed this
The "Empty at startup" and "Empty at shutdown" settings will
automatically empty the trash can at Desktop startup or at shutdown. Note that for
the latter to work, &xwp;'s extended shutdown procedure must be enabled. -->

<P>If <B>"Confirm empty"</B> is checked, you will get a chance to confirm emptying
the trash can.
<!-- V0.9.4: removed thisThis applies to both selecting the "Empty trash can" &popmenu;
item of the trash can and the automatic emptying described above. -->

<P>If <B>"Confirm destroy"</B> is checked, you will get a confirmation window when
you select "Destroy object" of a trash object's
<!-- V0.9.19: link added -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_popmenu.html">&popmenu;</A>.

<!-- V0.9.19: added this item -->
<P>If <B>"Always delete immediately"</B> is checked, &xwp; will perform all delete operations
directly, without moving the objects into the trash can first. In that case though,
you will not be able to recover objects that were accidentally deleted.
Note that you can perform an "immediate delete" for specific objects even if this
setting is not enabled; see
<!-- V0.9.20: link changed -->
<A HREF="tasks/tsk_delete.html">"Deleting objects"</A> for details.
<IFNDEF __EWORKPLACE__>
-- This setting corresponds to the "Replace true delete" feature that was previously
only on the "Features" page in the
<A HREF="objects/obj_xwpsetup.html">"&xwp; Setup" object</A>.
</IFNDEF>

<IFNDEF __NOXSHUTDOWN__>
<!-- V0.9.4: added this-->
<P>Note that if you are using &xwp;'s eXtended Shutdown, you can also have
the trash can emptied automatically before the system is shut down. This can be
enabled in the Desktop's <A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>.
