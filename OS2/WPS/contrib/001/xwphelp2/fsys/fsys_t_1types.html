<BODY>
The <B>"File types"</B> container on the left displays all the file types presently
known to &xwp;. If you click on any file type, the other two containers will
be filled with data (if present).

<P>Initially, this container will display all the WPS file types that have been defined
on your system.
<IFNDEF __EWORKPLACE__>
However, &xwp; adds functionality to that concept in that
file types can form a <B>hierarchical tree.</B>
</IFNDEF>
This container supports <B>drag and drop</B> within itself so that you can re-arrange your
file types to form such a tree. For example, you can drag the "&os2; Command File"
type onto the "Plain text" type to make it a subtype (that is, all "&os2; Command Files"
will also get the associations for "Plain text").
<P>
This container also has &popmenu;s to delete types, create new types, and for
"lazy" drag'n'drop ("pickup" and "drop" items).
