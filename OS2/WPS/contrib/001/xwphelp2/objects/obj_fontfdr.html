<P>The <B>"Fonts" folder</B> is a special folder which shows you all fonts which are
currently installed on your system.

<!-- V0.9.20: added this paragraph -->
<P>This object resides in the &link_syssetupfdr;.
Open the Desktop's <A HREF="glossary/gls_popmenu.html">&popmenu;</A> and select
"&syssetup;" to have that folder opened quickly.

<P>It is recommended to always open the Fonts folder in details view, because only
then can you see all the additional data the Fonts folder can display for your fonts.
If the Fonts folder does not display font details correctly, set its "details class"
to "Installed font" on the respective "View" page in the Fonts folder's
<A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>.

<P>The Fonts folder has the following special features:

<OL><LI>When it is first opened, it will <B>collect all fonts</B> which are currently
installed on your system and display them as <A HREF="objects/obj_fontobj.html">font objects</A>.
Font objects have a special <A HREF="font_view.html">sample view</A> which
allows you to take a look at the font.

<P><LI>You can quickly <B>install fonts</B> by
<!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_dragdrop.html">dragging</A>
<A HREF="objects/obj_fontfile.html">font files</A> and dropping them into the open
Fonts folder.

<P><LI>You can quickly <B>uninstall fonts</B> by selecting "Uninstall" from a font
object's &popmenu;.

</OL>Note: The Fonts folder is not intended to be used as a regular folder. Do not put
regular objects into it. The only files you may drag into the Fonts folder are
font files.
