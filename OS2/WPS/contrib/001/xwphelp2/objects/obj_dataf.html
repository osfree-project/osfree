<BODY>
Data files are used by programs to store data on disk. All file-system
objects that are neither <A HREF="objects/obj_pgmf.html">program files</A>
nor
<!-- V0.9.19: added link -->
&link_folders;
are considered data files by &os2;. They may or may not contain
human-readable data.

<P>Data files usually have a <B>type</B>. You can set a file's types
explicitly on the "Type" page in the file's
<A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>.

<IFNDEF __NEVEREXTASSOCS__>
If no explicit type has been assigned, &xwp; will assign an automatic type
to the file based on its file extension, which is the part of the object's
file name after the last dot.
</IFNDEF>

<P>In addition, data files frequently have
<!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
&link_progobjs;
<B>associated</B> with
them. This allows you to simply double-click on a data file to have the
associated program opened with the data file already loaded, or to select
a program from the data file's "Open" submenu in its &popmenu;.

<P>If the data file does not have a type assigned (neither explicitly nor
automatically), &os2; associates it with the
<IFDEF __EWORKPLACE__>
"Text Editor" object, which usually resides in the "Utilities" folder in
the "Programs" folder on your Desktop.
</IFDEF>
<IFNDEF __EWORKPLACE__>
System Editor.
</IFNDEF>

<!-- V0.9.19: changed all the following -->
<IFNDEF __NEVEREXTASSOCS__>
<P>You can configure &xwp;'s file types and associations on the "File types"
page in the <A HREF="objects/obj_wps.html">"Workplace Shell" object.</A>
<P>See <A HREF="glossary/gls_assocs.html">Types and associations</A> for an
introduction to associations between data files and programs.
</IFNDEF>
<IFDEF __NEVEREXTASSOCS__>
<P>You can change the associations between a program and data files on the
"Associations" page of a program's properties notebook.
