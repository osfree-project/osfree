        "Icon" Page: Current Icon

<!-- this is all new with V0.9.16 -->
<BODY>
The "Current icon" field displays what icon (picture) is currently used
to display the object in open
<!-- V0.9.19: added link -->
&link_folders;.

<P>Unless you have modified the object's icon, the default icon for the
object is usually determined from the object's
<A HREF="glossary/gls_wpsclasses.html">class</A>.
<!-- V0.9.19: added this -->
In other words, most objects have a default icon. However, you
can replace any icon on this page.

<P>To modify the object's icon, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>
<!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_dragdrop.html">Drag and drop</A>
an
<!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="objects/obj_os2wpicon.html">icon file</A> (usually with an
<CODE>.ICO</CODE> file name extension) into the "Current icon" field.

<!-- V0.9.19: added this -->
<P><LI><!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_dragdrop.html">Drag and drop</A>
any other object into the "Current icon"
field. That will copy the icon from the object that was dropped.

<P><LI>Push one of the <B>buttons</B> next to the icon display.

</UL>The following action buttons are available:

<UL><LI><B>"Edit icon"</B> will start the
<!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="objects/obj_os2iconedit.html">&os2; Icon Editor</A> with
the current icon of the object. You can then modify the icon. If you save
the icon with the Icon Editor, the object will pick up the change.

<P><LI><B>"Browse"</B> will open a standard &os2; file dialog which allows
you to find a new <CODE>.ICO</CODE> file to use for the object.

<P><LI><B>"Reset icon"</B> will reset the object's icon to its default, which
is determined by its <A HREF="glossary/gls_wpsclasses.html">class</A>. The button is
disabled if the object is already using the class default icon.

</UL>Note that <B>folder objects</B> usually have a second "Icon" page after
this page, which allows you to change the folder's animation icon.
