Icon files usually have a file name extension of <CODE>.ICO</CODE> and are
used to store &os2; icons on disk.

<P>An icon file contains <A HREF="objects/obj_os2wpbitmap.html">bitmaps</A>
in a special format to allow for defining transparency. Most icon files
contain pictures in several resolutions in order to avoid scaling under
different device resolutions.

<P>By default, icon files are associated with the &os2;
<A HREF="objects/obj_os2iconedit.html">Icon Editor</A>.
You can drag icon files onto the "Icon" page in any object's
<A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A> in order
to change the object's icon.
