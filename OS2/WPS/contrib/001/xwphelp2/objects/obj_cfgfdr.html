<BODY>
The &xwp; &cfgfdr; looks just like any folder, but is used by &xwp;
to determine additional menu items for all folder &popmenu;s. All objects that
you put into this folder will result in the creation of additional &popmenu;
items.

<!-- V0.9.20: added this -->
<P>This object resides in the
<IFDEF __EWORKPLACE__>
&link_lookfdr;.
Open the Desktop's <A HREF="glossary/gls_popmenu.html">&popmenu;</A> and select
"&syssetup;" to have that folder opened quickly.
</IFDEF>
<IFNDEF __EWORKPLACE__>
"XWorkplace Installation" folder.
</IFNDEF>

<P>See <A HREF="menus/menu_3config.html">Configuring &popmenu;s</A> for
instructions about how to change the default setup.
