<P>A <B>CD-ROM drive object</B> represents a CD-ROM or DVD drive on your system.
<A HREF="glossary/gls_dblclk.html">Double-click</A> on the object
to open a new window that displays the objects on the disk that
is currently inserted in the drive. If no disk is present, the system
displays an error message.

<P>CD-ROM stands for "Compact Disk Read Only Memory". As the name implies,
you cannot write data to a CD-ROM disk. CD-ROMs are most frequently
manufactured to hold large amounts of data, for example, dictionaries,
image libraries, or for software installations.

<P>If you have &os2; multimedia installed, you can also use your CD-ROM
drive to play audio CDs over your soundcard.

<P><B>Note:</B> If you have a CD writer or DVD drive, it is displayed as a
CD-ROM drive as well. In order to use the extra features supplied by such
hardware, you will need additional software. The Workplace Shell simply
treats a DVD drive as a larger capacity CD-ROM drive if a DVD is currently
inserted.
