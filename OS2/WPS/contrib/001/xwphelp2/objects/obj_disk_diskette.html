<P>A <B>diskette drive object</B> represents a diskette drive on your system.
<A HREF="glossary/gls_dblclk.html">Double-click</A> on the object
to open a new window that displays the objects on the diskette that
is currently inserted in the drive. If no diskette is present, the system
displays an error message.

<P>A <B>diskette</B> is a removable disk that can be inserted in and removed from
a diskette drive. Use diskettes to move information from one computer to
another, or to install new programs that are delivered on diskettes only.

<P>In the &link_drivesfdr;, you will see your diskette
drives listed as "Drive A" and "Drive B".

<P>There are several types of diskettes.
Older computers might still use <B>5.25-inch</B> diskettes, which are
thin, flexible, and somewhat fragile. Modern computers can typically
handle only <B>3.5-inch diskettes</B> any more, which are protected by a hard
plastic cover that makes them more durable.

<P>In any case, store diskettes in a safe place, away from dust, moisture,
magnetic fields (such as televisions, speakers, and computer monitors), and
extreme temperatures to avoid loss of data. Place diskette labels in such a
way that they do not cover an exposed area of the diskette. Note that using
a pencil or ball-point pen can damage the diskette.

<P>Before using a diskette for the first time, it must be
<A HREF="tasks/tsk_format.html">formatted</A>
to enable the operating system to locate information stored on the diskette.
When you format a diskette, the operating system also checks the diskette for
defects.
