<!-- V0.9.16: rewrote all the following -->
<P>The &xwp; trash can collects all the objects that you have recently deleted.
This allows you to recover objects that you deleted accidentally.
<!-- V0.9.20: much stuff replaced with this link -->
See <A HREF="tasks/tsk_delete.html">"Deleting objects"</A> for details.

<P>If you open the trash can (it supports only the Icon and Details views), you
can see all the objects that have been moved into it.

<P>To <B>restore</B> a trash object, either open its &popmenu; and select
"Restore object", which will move this object back to its original location,
or
<!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_dragdrop.html">drag</A>
it out of the trash can and drop it onto any folder, which will restore
the object in that location instead.

<P>To <B>permanently delete</B> a trash object, select "Destroy object" from
its &popmenu;.

<!-- V0.9.4: added this -->
<P>If the trash can is not empty,
<!-- rest as before -->
the trash can's &popmenu; offers you an additional menu item called
<B>"Empty trash can"</B>, which will permanently delete <I>all</I> the objects
which have been moved into the trash can.
