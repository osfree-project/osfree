A program file is a special kind of
<A HREF="objects/obj_dataf.html">data file</A>
that contains a program with executable code for your computer.

<!-- V0.9.20: rewrote all the following -->
<P>Among others, data files with the <CODE>.EXE</CODE> (for
"executable") file name extension will be considered program files by &os2;.
If &xwp; finds icon data within the program file and can interpret it, the
program file's icon will automatically be set accordingly. Otherwise the
program file receives a default icon, depending on its
<A HREF="glossary/gls_sessions.html">session type</A>.

<P>In many cases, you can simply
<A HREF="glossary/gls_dblclk.html">double-click</A> on a program file to
start it. However, if you are not sure what the program does, you should
be cautious in doing so because many program files are not designed to be
started manually.

<P>This is also why the recommended way to start applications in &os2; is
to create &link_progobjs; for them.
Note that many software packages come with an installation program that
will do this for you automatically.
