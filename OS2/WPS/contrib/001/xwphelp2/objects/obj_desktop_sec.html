<P>This is a secondary desktop folder. Your system can have more than
one desktop, but only one will be the default desktop that is opened at
system startup and covers the full screen.

<P>You might have a secondary desktop if you have installed &os2; over
an existing version of OS/2 or eComStation. In that case, your old
desktop is preserved, and a <A HREF="tasks/tsk_crshadow.html">shadow</A>
to it is placed on the new default desktop.
