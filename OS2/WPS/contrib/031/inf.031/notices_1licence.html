<!-- This document has been largely rewritten with V0.85. -->
<!-- Changed with V0.9.0: replace XFolder with &xwp;  -->
<BODY>
<!-- V0.9.0: Added "&xwp;" to the following -->
While older XFolder versions were "plain" freeware,
all XFolder versions since V0.80 and &xwp; too have been placed
under the <B>GNU General Public Licence (GPL)</B> Version 2.

<P>You can find the full text
of the GPL in the plain-text file <CITE>COPYING</CITE>
in the &xwp; installation directory. A formatted version of this
document is available on the <A HREF="notices_2gpl.html">next page</A> of this document.

<P><B>By installing &xwp; on your system, you declare your agreement to the
terms and conditions of the GNU General Public Licence, Version 2, as contained
in the file COPYING in the &xwp; installation directory.</B>

<P>The GPL means more Legalese, but also <B>more rights</B> for you as a user and,
if applicable, developer.
The most obvious change is that &xwp;'s source code is also released.

<P>The following brief explanations are intended as an introduction to the terms
and conditions of the GPL only. They are not part of the licence agreement, for
which only the terms and conditions in the <CITE>COPYING</CITE> file shall prevail.

<UL><LI>If you are an <B>&xwp; user,</B> not much has changed.
You may still use &xwp; without any payment to anyone.
The GPL does not restrict you on this matter, because it only imposes restrictions
on distribution and modification of software.
However, there is still <B>no warranty</B> whatsoever. If &xwp; ruins your system
and your work of the last 30 years is lost, sorry. (This is not very probable though).
Refer to the bottom of the
<A HREF="notices_2gpl.html">GPL</A> for the detailed disclaimer.

<BR><LI>If you're a <B>distributor,</B> you may still distribute the whole
&xwp; package.
However, the GPL will probably require you to also distribute the complete
&xwp; source code.
Refer to the <A HREF="notices_2gpl.html">GPL</A> for details.

<BR><LI>If you're a <B>developer,</B> you now have the source code, which you may
use and modify. However, if you base your own software on &xwp;'s source code,
the GPL will most probably <B>require you to place your work
under the GPL also.</B> This means that you cannot use the sources if you don't
publish all your sources also.
<P>Even though the source code is published, all developers retain the copyright to what
they've written.
<P>The GPL deals with these issues extensively. Before you use or modify any code
parts of &xwp;, make sure you read the GPL thoroughly.
If your software is GPL'd also,
<B>by all means feel free to use the code.</B>
If you have any questions, feel free to contact the developer's team.

</UL>And now: have fun with &xwp;!
<BR>
