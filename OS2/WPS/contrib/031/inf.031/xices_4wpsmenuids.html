        WPS Menu IDs
    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<!-- Changed with V0.9.0: replace XFolder with &xwp; -->
<BODY>
When using the WPObject setup string <CITE>MENUITEMSELECTED</CITE>,
the following menu IDs
might be useful to you. Please keep in mind that not all of these are intended for
all kinds of objects; for example, "Format disk" does not make sense on folders,
and I don't know what will happen if you try this out. If you're lucky, nothing
happens.
<P>Note that the new menu items introduced by &xwp; have no <I>fixed</I> menu IDs,
so they're not listed here. Instead, the &xwp; menu items have <I>variable</I> menu IDs,
whose base is specified with the "&xwp; menu item ID offset" global setting.
This base is added to <CITE>WPMENUID_USER</CITE>, which is 0x6500 (25856 decimal),
and the &xwp; menu ID's are then added to that base to allow compatibility with
other WPS enhancers. So if you wish to use an &xwp; menu item with
<CITE>MENUITEMSELECTED</CITE>, you need some utility such as <CITE>XRAY</CITE> to
figure out the "real" menu id. The ID will of course change again if you change the
offset setting.

<P>The following WPS menu IDs are taken from the Warp 3 Toolkit docs
(I have excluded those which make no sense when called from REXX):

<BR>The following IDs are not officially documented by IBM, thus their symbols
are not official (but invented by me). Most of them are available on &warp4; and
higher only.
The menu IDs are now in hexadecimal
(use the REXX function X2D to convert them to decimal):
