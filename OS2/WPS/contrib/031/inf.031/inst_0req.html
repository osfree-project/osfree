<!-- V1.0.1: all rewritten -->
<BODY>
Starting with V1.0.0, &xwp; requires at least <B>OS/2 Warp 4.</B>
It will <i>not</i> run on previous versions, for it calls
OS/2 API functions not present on OS/2 Warp 3 and before.

<P>&xwp; is currently being developed and tested on eComStation 1.0 only,
but should work on Warp 4 as well. I do not think it relies on functionality
that is present only in newer fixpaks (especially since the IBM source code
merge with FP13), but then I didn't test this.
