"Turbo folders" are a shorthand name for a large number of enhancements to
the internal handling of folder contents in the Workplace Shell. In short,
opening folders with lots of files in them will become <I>significantly</I>
faster.

<P>For safety, turbo folders are disabled by default. You can turn them on
in the <A HREF="sys_2global.html">"&xwp; Setup" object</A>.

<!-- V1.0.1 (2002-12-15) [umoeller] added this -->
<P>The speed enhancements provided with folder populating are described on
this page. Note that starting with V1.0.1, when you enable turbo folders,
extended associations are enabled automatically as well. As it has turned
out, enabling only one of them made the WPS quite unstable. See
<a href="file_1extassocs.html">Extended file associations</a> for a
detailed description of that feature.

<P><B>Short description</B>

<P>When a folder is first opened in the WPS, it is "populated" -- which means
that all the files are collected from the directory that is represented
by the folder. As you will know, the WPS is not good at handling large amounts
of files. Opening folders with many objects (say, a thousand files or more)
can hog the system for minutes.

<P>"Turbo folders" can partly fix this problem. Below is a benchmark comparison
for some pathological folders with the time in seconds that populating these
folders has taken on my system. This benchmark only shows the time that
invoking the <CODE>QUICKOPEN=IMMEDIATE</CODE> XFolder setup string has consumed.
As usual, your results may vary, depending on the speed of your hard disks
and processor(s).

<PRE>
                        turbo off       turbo on

    JFS folder with       160 s           53 s
    10,000 files

    JFS folder with       211 s           60 s
    13,000 files

    HPFS folder with                      56 s
    10,000 files
</PRE>

Apparently the time the WPS normally takes for populating folders increases
exponentially with the number of files in the folder.

<P><B>Detailed description</B>

<P>Essentially, the "turbo folders" feature is a full rewrite of the folder
populate code. &xwp; uses the following techniques to make this a lot faster:

<UL><LI>Each folder now has a binary balanced tree containing all the objects that
have been added to the folder's internal content list so far. For file-system
objects, this tree is sorted by the objects' short real names. This makes
it much more efficient to find out if the object is already in the tree or
still needs to be added. I assume that the original checkup code in the WPS
is responsible for the enourmous delays with large amounts of files.

<P><LI>Instead of only one extra thread, "turbo folders" will start two
extra threads for populating a folder. One is reponsible for collecting file
data from the disk (via the
<CODE>DosFindFirst</CODE> and
<CODE>DosFindNext</CODE> system APIs), and the other one is responsible for
checking whether the object is already awake and creating a new object, if
necessary.

<P>Depending on the file system, the above two APIs can be quite slow when extended
attributes have to be collected (as is the case with the WPS). While this happens,
the calling thread is blocked, doing nothing but waiting
for data from the hard disk to arrive. This idle time can now be used by the other
thread for creating the object in memory, which can be quite time consuming as well.

<P>In addition, using two threads will scale better on multi-processor
(SMP) systems.

<P>The above two techniques together made folder populating
so much faster. The time that is now needed for populating the folder roughly
equates the time that the system spends in the
<CODE>DosFindFirst</CODE> and
<CODE>DosFindNext</CODE> system APIs, so I do not think this can be sped up much
more (unless somebody manages to make these system APIs more efficient).

<P><LI>"Turbo folders" also completely replaces the icon loading for executable
files. As you will know, if you open a folder with .EXE files, the WPS will
attempt to find an icon in the executable and, if one is found, use it for
the object. Program and data file objects will also load icons from executables.

<P>The WPS code for loading icons suffers from several limitations. Most
importantly, it appears to be slow. This code has also been totally replaced in
&xwp;.

<P>In addition, the WPS does not appear to share icons much in the WPS.
&xwp; will also attempt to reuse icons as much as possible to avoid the
need to reload them from the executables all the time.

<P>Essentially I am no longer allowing the WPS to read
executable icons at all, but will only use my own code for now. This works
for LX and Win16 and OS/2 NE executables. Win32 PE resources (as used by
most executables under Windows 95 or newer) are presently
not understood; PE files will receive a dull default icon, but at least the
WPS will no longer hang forever with them.

<P>As one side effect, this will change the behavior for Win16 icons if the
system icon size is 40x40; instead of scaling, &xwp; will now center the
32x32 icon.
