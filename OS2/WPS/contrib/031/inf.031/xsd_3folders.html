<!-- Changed with V0.81 -->
<!-- Changed with V0.9.0: replace XFolder with &xwp; -->
<!-- Changed with V0.9.0: see notes below -->
<BODY>
<!-- V0.9.0: add the following line -->
<B>Classes: XFldObject, XFldDesktop, XFolder, XFldStartup, XFldShutdown</B><HR>
<!-- V0.9.0 -->
&xwp; offers you separate startup and shutdown folders.

<!-- this paragraph inserted with V0.81; changed with V0.9.0 -->
<P><B>Note:</B> The startup and shutdown folders are not automatically created
by the install program to avoid confusion. Please open the
<A HREF="sys_1intro.html">"&xwp; Setup"</A>
object to create them manually.

<P>If &xwp; finds the <STRONG>&xwp; Startup Folder</STRONG> upon Desktop startup, it will process its contents
in a way much similar to what the WPS does with its own startup folder. The main differences
are:

<UL><LI>You may set a certain time which &xwp; will wait in between starting objects. The
conventional startup folder sometimes leads to problems if you have many objects in there, which
are normally all started at the same time, sometimes causing the WPS to hang at startup.
<!-- V0.9.0: changed the following line -->
This delay can be changed in the &xwp; Startup folder's own settings notebook.

<BR><LI>You will be able to watch the progress of the startup process in a separate window
<!-- V0.9.0: changed the following line -->
(which can also be turned off in the &xwp; Startup folder's own settings notebook,
if you don't like it).

<BR><LI>Startup can be cancelled while it is running.
<!-- V0.9.0: changed the following -->

<BR><LI>Startup can completely be skipped by holding down the "Shift" key during WPS
startup, which makes the <A HREF="xsd_01intro.html">"Startup panic" dialog</A> appear.

<BR><LI>The &xwp; Startup Folder is also processed after a Desktop restart, while the
regular Desktop startup folder is not.
<!-- this paragraph modified with V0.81 -->
This applies only if you had selected the respective checkbox
in the "Restart Desktop" confirmation dialog box.

<BR><LI>The &xwp; Startup Folder now (V0.80) has a "Start folder content" menu item
which allows you to have its contents started even after the WPS is up.

</UL>On the other hand, the <STRONG>&xwp; Shutdown Folder</STRONG> will be processed before
the eXtended Shutdown (and not before the regular shutdown). As opposed to with the Startup Folder,
you may not set a delay here, but &xwp; waits before starting the next object until the
currently opened object has been closed again. Only if all objects started from the Shutdown
Folder have been closed, the eXtended Shutdown actually begins.

<P>The Shutdown folder can be useful if you need to have certain programs executed before
turning off your system.
<!-- V0.9.19: removed this (I have no use for this, but apparently many people have.) -->
You could,
for example, create some REXX script which does some cleanup before shutting down, such as
properly logging off your network, deleting TEMP files, or whatever you can think of.

<P>For both the &xwp; Startup and Shutdown folders, you may define the order in which objects
are started. This works just the same way as described
on the <A HREF="menu_5order.html">respective page</A> for the &xwp; Configuration Folders.
