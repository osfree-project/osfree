If you have a three-button mouse, &xwp;'s PM hook also allows you to reconfigure
mouse button 3 (the middle mouse button on most mice) to do useful things, since that
button is normally useless with &os2; and most &os2; applications.

<P>There are two mouse button 3 features at this point:

<UL><LI>&xwp; allows to have all single mouse button 3 clicks converted to
<B>mouse button 1 double clicks.</B> This allows you, for example, to click on a Desktop object
with mouse button 3 once, and the object will be opened as if you had double-clicked
on it.

<P><LI>&xwp; also allows you to <B>scroll windows contents</B> by dragging the mouse
while mouse button 3 is held down. If the window under the mouse has scroll bars, the
window will be scrolled as if you had used the scroll bars even if the mouse is somewhere
else over the window's contents. This saves you a lot of mouse mileage.

</UL>Both features can be enabled in the "Mouse" object on the new second "Mappings"
page, which is added by &xwp;. There are a lot of configuration options to adjust
these features to your needs. Press the "Help" button on that page for details.

<P><B>Note:</B> That page is only visible if the XWPMouse class is installed
<I>and</I> the &xwp; hook has been enabled in
<A HREF="sys_1intro.html">"&xwp; Setup".</A>
