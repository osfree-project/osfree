<!-- this paragraph modified with V0.81 -->
<!-- added the following advertisement with V0.84 ;-) -->
XFolder offers you the prettiest and most flexible folder status bars
(in my view, that is).
These are highly configurable
on the "Status bars" pages in
the new <A HREF="sys_2global.html">"Workplace Shell" object</A> and can also be
switched on and off <A HREF="fldr_7settings.html">individually</A> for each folder.

<!-- this paragraph modified with V0.81 -->
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Folder status bars are disabled per default to prevent
side-effects in case you already have software which adds folder status bars. Go to
the <A HREF="sys_2global.html">"Workplace Shell" object</A> to turn the XFolder
status bars on, but make sure to disable this feature in other software first; otherwise
results are unpredictable.

<P><IMG SRC="intro_4statusbars.gif">
<P>Status bars operate in <B>three modes,</B> that is, they can display different information
depending on how many objects are currently selected in the folder container:

<!-- this paragraph modified with V0.81 -->
<UL><LI>"No-objects mode": this applies when no object is selected at all.
Per default, this displays the
total number of objects in the folder and their total size as well as the
free space on the folder's drive.

<!-- this paragraph modified with V0.81 -->
<BR><LI>"One-object mode": this applies when exactly one object is selected.
Depending on the class of the object, different information is displayed.
For example, folders and data files will display file system information
(real name, class, size, date, and time).

<BR><LI>"Multiple-objects mode": this applies when more than one object is selected.
Per default, this displays the number of selected items, the total number of objects in the
folder and the added size of the selected items (as in the above screenshot).

<!-- this paragraph modified with V0.81 -->
</UL>For each of these three modes you may <B>configure</B> freely what will be displayed in the status bars.
This is explained in detail on the
<A HREF="stat_3config.html">"Configuring status bars"</A> page.

<!-- the following paragraph about fonts and colors has been moved to the
     new "looks" page (stat_2extras.html) with V0.84 -->
