<P><B>&xwp; 1.0.1 (February 2, 2003)</B>

<p>

Miscellaneous changes:

<UL><LI>Common: Removed global "resize settings pages" setting, which is always enabled now.
(Bug #285, 286)

<P><LI>Common: Removed the annoying "hwndDaemonObject is NULLHANDLE" log message on every
startup.
(Bug #64)

<P><LI>Turbo folders: Removed the "extended associations" setting, which is now combined
with the "turbo folders" setting. Using only one of them proved to make the system
unstable, and this turned out to be impossible to fix without a lot of effort.

<P><LI>Folder split views: Sped up emptying containers on folder change.
(Bug #270)

<P><LI>Pager: Adjusted default window position to not overlap eCenter.

<P><LI>XCenter: made introductory help a global setting.

<P><LI>XCenter: Removed the xwhealth widget from the distribution, since the author has
a more up-to-date version on his web page and no longer supplies me with updates. The one
from previous versions should still work.

</ul>Bugfixes:

<UL><LI>Common: Fixed XWPProgram class breaking the entire WPS class setup during initialization.
(Bug #266)

<P><LI>Common: Mouse pointer was sometimes set wrong over my containers with checkboxes. Fixed.
(Bug #266)

<P><LI>Folder split views: Fixed a dangling pointer in folder background loading.

<P><LI>Folder split views: Preventing the Desktop from ever opening in split view.
(Bug #325)

<P><LI>Folder split views: Folders created with "Create New" under disk object did not appear immediately.
Fixed.
(Bug #284)

<P><LI>Batch-rename objects: Raised internal buffer size to avoid "string too long" messages
for longer filenames.

<P><LI>Lazy icon loading/shadow icons: Fixed blank icons of shadows to folders. (Bug #329)

<P><LI>Lazy icon loading/shadow icons: Fixed ICO/PTR files being reset to assoc icons.
(Bug #293)

<P><LI>Folder refresh: &xwp; now correctly detects when a .LONGNAME EA has changed.
(Bug #238)

<P><LI>Font folder: Fixed wrong error message.
(Bug #36)

<P><LI>File operations: "Title clash" dialog frequently had no checkbox enabled, even though
it worked correctly otherwise.
(Bug #229)

<P><LI>WPS class list: fixed trap on open.
(Bug #243)

<P><LI>OS/2 kernel: POPUPLOG drive was wrong. Fixed by Paul Ratcliffe.
(Bug #37)

<P><LI>OS/2 kernel: CLASSPATH system path was wrong. Fixed by Paul Ratcliffe.
(Bug #272)

<P><LI>XCenter: "Reduce desktop workarea" finally positions maximized windows without overlapping.
(Bug #246)

<P><LI>XCenter: Object buttons that pointed to now invalid objects would cause internal
traps in PM because the icon handle was wrong. Fixed.

<P><LI>XCenter: Tray widget now remembers background color.
(Bug #58)

<P><LI>XCenter: Changing top/bottom location of XCenter wrongly set a screen border action.
Fixed.
(Bug #252)
