Starting with V0.9.3, &xwp; allows you to give certain keys which normally don't
work under &os2; a special meaning. You can then use those extra keys as object
hotkeys as well. In order for this to work, you will need to
register those keys with the "Function keys" page in the enhanced "Keyboard" object.

<P>This feature is implemented through the &xwp; PM hook as well. To understand
how this is working (and before you use the "Function keys" page), the following
explanations should be understood.

<P>Keyboard processing is a complex issue under any operating system. It involves
interpreting hardware messages and translating those according to the current
language settings.

<P>Under &os2;, this processing is done on several layers of the system. For one,
there is the hardware keyboard device driver which gets loaded though a BASEDEV
statement in &cfgsys;. This one reacts to hardware interrupts raised by the
physical keyboard hardware and thus receives really every single keystroke on the
system.

<P>The &os2; Kernel then processes those keystrokes for the application which currently
has the input focus. Further processing is different depending on the type of application.
Presentation Manager (PM) applications (including the Workplace Shell)
usually receive a message that a key has been
pressed or released. The &xwp; PM hook can thus intercept these messages and
manipulate them. (This is how <A HREF="mouse_81objhotkeys.html">object hotkeys</A>
work as well, by the way.)

<P>Unfortunately, the default &os2; keyboard processing is still based on the original
101/102-key IBM-compatible AT keyboards introduced in the 1980's.
Today, many keyboards have additional keys which
are not recognized at all by &os2; or simply produce a character output even though they
aren't really supposed to.

<P>Those extra function keys could be the three "Windows" keys found on most
keyboards sold today. In addition, there are some extended keyboards which have
additional "multimedia" keys. Also, many laptops have some extra keys.

<P>The &xwp; PM hook can identify the physical key which has actually been
pressed by evaluating the <B>hardware scan code</B> of the key, which is passed to
any PM application directly from the keyboard hardware. On every keyboard, every key
should have a unique such code. This code has nothing to do with the ASCII code of
a character, it's just a unique number assigned to each physical key on the keyboard.
For example, the "Shift" key will have such a code as well as the "A" key, even though
the "Shift" key alone will produce no ASCII (character) output.

<P>So the &xwp; hook needs to know the hardware scan code of your function keys
in order to be able to react to them. As a result, you will need to <B>register</B>
your extra keys with &xwp;. Those keys are then called
<B>"&xwp; function keys"</B> and will be recognized by &xwp;. You can,
for example, use them as <A HREF="mouse_81objhotkeys.html">object hotkeys</A>
after having registered them.

<P>To <B>register such a function key with &xwp;,</B> go to the enhanced
"Keyboard" object and switch to the new "Function keys" page. Right-click on the
container whitespace and select "Add function key". You'll get additional help by
pressing the "Help" buttons there.

<P><B>Warnings.</B>

<OL><LI>There is virtually <B>no error checking</B> when registering a
function key with &xwp;. Scan codes are hardware-dependent, so there's no way
for &xwp; to tell whether a certain scan code really shouldn't be registered.
For example, you could also register the "Enter" or any character key as a function
key, which really isn't a good idea. <B>So register only "real" extra keys with
&xwp;, or the key might no longer work.</B>

<P><LI>Some keys will refuse to be registered. If this happens, this means that the
keyboard hardware doesn't produce a scan code for the key. I have a Fujitsu multimedia
keyboard with some 15 extra keys, and three of them just don't work. I guess we'd need
a device driver to interpret those extra three keys, but this is beyond my knowledge.

<P><LI>As usual, the function keys will only be detected while a PM window has the focus.
They will not work in full-screen DOS or full-screen &winos2; sessions.
