Bugfixes:

<UL><LI>An annoying benign error box sometimes appeared complaining about sessions not
being started in the foreground. The 'error' is now ignored. Bug 635.
Fixed by Paul Ratcliffe.

<P><LI>Disabling the XWP Hook with an active XCenter Window List widget caused endless traps.
Bug 526. Fixed by Paul Ratcliffe.

<P><LI>Fixed folder status bar colours which defaulted to Black on Grey rather than following
the settings from the currently selected scheme. Fixed by Paul Ratcliffe.

<P><LI>XShutdown now closes Workarea folders first, preventing problems with dependent objects
being closed first and thus not reopening when the WPS restarts. Bug 273.

<P><LI>Choosing "Split view" as a view for a WPHost object caused a trap. Bug 530.
Fixed by Paul Ratcliffe.

<P><LI>XShutdown now disables HPFS's Lazy Writer automatically when shutting down the system.
Bug 404. Fixed by Paul Ratcliffe.

<P><LI>Upgrading from eWP to XWP now preserves eWP's settings rather than using the default
XWP settings. Bug 644. Fixed by Paul Ratcliffe.

<P><LI>The Cancel button on the System Startup dialog did nothing while processing Quick Open Folders.
Bug 460. Fixed by Paul Ratcliffe.

<P><LI>The Cancel button on the XShutdown Folder progress dialog caused a Shutdown to occur
rather than cancelling the rest of the procedure.
Bug 402. Fixed by Paul Ratcliffe.

<P><LI>Using the XPager hotkeys to switch desktops didn't restart the "Flash to top" timer
after the first switch. Fixed by Paul Ratcliffe.

<P><LI>Default font was wrong for DBCS versions of OS/2.
Bug 655. Fixed by Bart van Leeuwen.

<P><LI>The GB and gB displays in folder status bars were too large by a factor of
1024 and 1000 respectively. Fixed by Paul Ratcliffe.

<P><LI>Opening the context menu for a Drive object would generate an XWP exception beep,
which was caused by an incompatibility with MCP FP5. Fixed by Paul Ratcliffe.

rebooting.
Bug 31. Fixed by Bart van Leeuwen.

<P><LI>On DBCS systems, the text in tooltips was truncated on the last character/word.
Bug 676. Fixed by Bart van Leeuwen.

<P><LI>"Display Recovery Choices at each system startup" flag and the associated timeout
options were missing from Desktop Archives properties.
