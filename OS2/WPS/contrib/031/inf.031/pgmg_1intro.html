&pgr; was originally PageMage, a freeware program written by Carlos Ugarte.
From what I know, the last public version was 0.36.
Since the author no longer had the time to work on
it, he published the sources under the GPL.

<!-- V1.0.1: changed this -->
<P>While earlier &xwp; versions were still based on the original PageMage sources,
this is no longer the case. &pgr; is a complete rewrite, even though it may look
quite similar and borrowed some good ideas from PageMage.

<P>&pgr; is initially disabled. To turn it on, go to the "Features" page in the
<A HREF="sys_2global.html">"&xwp; Setup" object</A> and check the respective box.
This requires that the <B>&xwp; PM hook</B> also be installed.

<P>&pgr; is a <B>virtual desktop utility for &os2;.</B> Essentially, it allows
the user to work on several desktops at once. Your screen is considered one out
of several, and you can switch between these. This effectively multiplies your
working area since windows can reside outside your currently visible desktop and
still be switched to simply by switching to another desktop.

<P><IMG SRC="pagemage.gif">

<P>Traditionally, most virtual desktop programs show a representation of the
overall desktop in a window, highlighting the current desktop. The standard
mechanism for switching desktops has been to click (with a mouse) on one
of the other desktops, which would remove the current desktop's windows
and display the new desktop's windows.

<P>&pgr; can be <B>configured</B> in the new
<A HREF="sys_1intro.html">"Screen" settings object,</A> where
&xwp; inserts several pages.
