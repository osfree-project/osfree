XFolder can add new keyboard accelerators
(or hotkeys, or shortcuts, whatever terminology you prefer...)
for use within folders. Note that these keys ONLY work when a folder has the focus. They
do not work when any other window is currently active.
<P>All the following keys are just shortcuts to certain menu items.
<P>The default configuration adds the following keys for use within folders:

<UL><LI><STRONG>F5</STRONG> will refresh the folder contents.

<BR><LI><STRONG>Ctrl+A</STRONG> will select all objects in the folder.

<BR><LI><STRONG>Ctrl+D</STRONG> will de-select all objects in the folder.

<BR><LI><STRONG>Ctrl+S</STRONG> will <A HREF="menu_7selectsome.html">select objects by name</A>.

<BR><LI><STRONG>Ctrl+N</STRONG> will sort the folder contents by name.

<BR><LI><STRONG>Ctrl+W</STRONG> will sort the folder contents by last write date.

<BR><LI><STRONG>Ctrl+Y</STRONG> will sort the folder contents by type.

<BR><LI><STRONG>Ctrl+Z</STRONG> will sort the folder contents by size.

<BR><LI><STRONG>Ctrl+E</STRONG> will sort the folder contents by
<A HREF="fldr_38sort.html">file name extension</A>.

<BR><LI><STRONG>Ctrl+Shift+D</STRONG> will open the Details view of the same folder.

<BR><LI><STRONG>Ctrl+Shift+I</STRONG> will open the Icon view of the same folder.

<BR><LI><STRONG>Backspace</STRONG> will open the parent folder (i.e. the folder
in which the currently open folder resides itself).

<BR><LI><STRONG>Shift+Backspace</STRONG> will open the parent folder and close
the current folder also.

<BR><LI><STRONG>Ctrl+Shift+S</STRONG> will open the settings of the current folder.

<BR><LI><STRONG>Ctrl+Insert</STRONG> will
<A HREF="menu_91copyfilename.html">copy the filename(s)</A>
of the currently selected object(s) in the folder to the clipboard.

</UL>The above keys are part of the XFolder default configuration.
You can quite freely re-assign hotkeys in the
<A HREF="sys_2global.html">Global Settings</A>, where you will find more
than 30 configurable
items, including many &warp4; menu items.
Press the "Help" button on the settings page for details.
