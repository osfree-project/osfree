<B>Classes: XWPScreen</B>
<HR>
&pgr; needs <B>no special hardware</B> to implement these virtual desktops.
While the various implementations of the Unix X Window system (one of
which is XFree/2, which runs under &os2;) can actually use additional memory
on your video card to have room for several desktops, &pgr; simply moves
windows around your screen.

<P>To make this clear: With &pgr;, technically, you still only have one screen.
Neither PM nor your video driver know anything about virtual desktops.
All &pgr; does when switching desktops is to move windows off of and onto your
one visible screen. That is, if you switch one desktop to the right, &pgr; moves
all windows to the left by the size of your physical screen (which makes them
invisible, of course).
As a result, no special hardware or software or drivers are required. If your
computer can handle moving windows, it can use &pgr;.

<P>The small &pgr; pager window then does a number of calculations to make all
windows look as if they were part of a huge virtual screen, but your physical screen
really doesn't change -- it's the windows that are moved.

<P>&pgr; also needs the &xwp; PM hook to be able to track window movement --
for one, to reflect window changes in the &pgr; window, secondly to be informed
when windows are created or destroyed for any reason. It can then, for example,
automatically switch desktops (that is, move all windows) if the focus is given
to a window of another desktop.
