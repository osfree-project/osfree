<!-- Changed with V0.9.0: replace XFolder with &xwp; -->

<!-- V0.9.0 -->
One of the major features of &xwp; is to improve the shutdown procedure of &os2;.
<P><B>Important note:</B> &xshutdown; is disabled per default in order to avoid
confusion. You will need to enable &xshutdown; in the
<!-- V0.9.0: changed the following -->
new <A HREF="sys_2global.html">"&xwp; Setup" object</A>.
<P>After enabling &xshutdown;, selecting "Shutdown" from the Desktop's context menu
will start &xwp;'s shutdown procedure instead of &os2;'s standard shutdown.
<P>After selecting "Shutdown", a dialog box similar to the following
will pop up:
<P><IMG SRC="shutdown2.gif">
<P>The main new features of &xshutdown; are:
<UL><LI>You can choose to <B>automatically reboot</B> your computer
after shutdown has completed.
<P>You may even
create your own reboot options, e.g. reboot to a certain Boot Manager partition directly.
This is explained in detail when you press the "Actions" button on page 1 of the
"XDesktop" pages in the Desktop's settings notebook.
<BR><LI>&xshutdown; can be <B>cancelled</B> even after shutdown has started.
<BR><LI>&xshutdown; will display the progress of the shutdown procedure, and if some application
"hangs", i.e. it cannot be closed, you can choose to <B>skip</B> it
and continue the shutdown sequence without waiting for this application to close:
<P><IMG SRC="shutdown.gif">

</UL>The automatic reboot requires that DOS.SYS be installed through &cfgsys;. On Warp 4, this is done
per default. On OS/2 Warp 3, you might need to add the following line to &cfgsys;:
<P><CITE>DEVICE=X:\OS2\BOOT\DOS.SYS</CITE>
<P>with X: being your OS/2 boot drive.
<P>You can configure (and turn off) the eXtended Shutdown on a new settings page of the
<A HREF="fldr_7settings.html">Desktop's Settings</A> notebook.

<!-- V0.9.0: added the following -->
<P>If you're interested in how &xshutdown; works internally, please see the
<A HREF="further_2howxshutdown.html">respective page</A> in the "&xwp; Internals"
chapter.
