In order to change a certain object's setting with REXX, use the following
RexxUtil function:
<PRE>rc = SysSetObjectData(<I>name</I>, <I>setup</I>)</PRE>
<P>with:
<P><CODE><I>name</I></CODE> being the object you wish to change (referenced either by a
full path specification or an object ID, such as <CODE>&lt;WP_DESKTOP&gt;</CODE>);
<P><CODE><I>setup</I></CODE> being one of the WPS setup strings, which always
have a <CODE><I>keyword</I>=<I>data</I></CODE> syntax. You can combine several settings
by separating them with semicola (<CODE>;</CODE>).
<P>Example:

<PRE>  if SysSetObjectData(directory(),"NOMOVE=YES;DEFAULTVIEW=ICON") then
    Say "Settings changed!"
</PRE>
<P>This will change the folder settings for the current directory, which is useful for
scripts called by XFolder, which have the intended directory already changed to.
<P>See the <A HREF="rexx.inf#syssetobjectdata">&os2; REXX Reference</A> for details.
