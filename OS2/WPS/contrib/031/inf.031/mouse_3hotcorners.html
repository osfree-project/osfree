&xwp; also implements "screen border objects", which means that you can configure
the &xwp; PM hook to automatically open a certain object in its default view if
the mouse pointer is moved to one of the four corners
<!-- V0.9.4: added this -->
or one of the four borders of your screen.
<!-- V0.9.9: added this -->
You can also configure the &xwp; PM hook to initiate desktop switching in
such cases if &pgr; is enabled.

<P>For example, on my system, I have configured this feature to automatically open
the "Drives" folder when I move the mouse pointer to the top-right corner of the
screen.

<P>In addition to opening objects, &xwp; can also display the PM window list with
this feature.

<!-- V0.9.9: removed this paragraph -->
<!-- P Like the "sliding focus" feature, this functionality can be influenced on the
new "Movement" page in the "Mouse" object, which usually resides in your "System Setup"
folder. -->

<!-- V0.9.9: replaced XWPMouse with XWPScreen here too -->
<P><B>Note:</B> That page is only visible if the XWPScreen class is installed
<I>and</I> the &xwp; hook has been enabled in
<A HREF="sys_1intro.html">"&xwp; Setup".</A>
