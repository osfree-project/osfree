1. INTRODUCTION
===============

    Welcome to XWorkplace V1.0.1.

    XWorkplace is a complex set of replacement classes for the
    OS/2 Workplace Shell to enhance the WPS's behavior in many
    ways.

    This README has additional information which is not included
    in the XWorkplace User Guide. Please read through all of this
    before installing.

    After installation, you can find this README in the main
    install directory.


    About this release
    ------------------

    This is a 100% bug-fix release compared to V1.0.0. No new
    features are introduced, but a number of bugs, including
    that famous XWPProgram screwup, have been fixed.

    For details, refer to the "Version Notices" in the
    "XWorkplace User Guide". To extract the documentation
    only, see "3. INSTALLATION" below.


2. REQUIREMENTS
===============

    XWorkplace is developed and tested only under eComStation
    1.0, which is equivalent -- as far as the OS/2 code base
    is concerned -- to the Merlin Convenience Package 1 (MCP1).

    NOTE: As opposed to previous releases, XWorkplace 1.0.0
    and higher will NO LONGER work on OS/2 Warp 3. SO DO NOT
    TRY TO INSTALL THIS ON WARP 3.

    The following OS/2 versions should be safe, since they are
    based on roughly the same IBM code:

    --  Warp 4 FP 15

    --  WarpServer for e-Business

    --  Merlin/Aurora Convenience Packages

    --  eComStation 1.0

    Older Warp 4 versions might work, but are not presently
    being tested.


3. INSTALLATION
===============

    XWorkplace must be installed using WarpIN. After all files
    have been copied, WarpIN will restart your Workplace Shell
    to make sure the changes become active. A reboot should not
    be necessary.

    WARNING: It was reported that the Workplace Shell hangs itself
    up after the restart if you have the "Automatic lockup on
    startup" setting enabled. In that case, disable that setting
    before allowing WarpIN to restart the WPS.

    ---> In any case, before installing, MAKE A WPS BACKUP.

    If you are still unsure whether you should use XWorkplace at
    this point, you can select the "Documentation" package in this
    archive only. This way can then read through XWorkplace's
    documentation first and decide then whether to actually install
    all of it. This will not modify your system. To install later,
    simply double-click on XWorkplace's installation EXE again.


4. UPGRADING
============

    Upgrading from XWorkplace
    -------------------------

    IMPORTANT: If you are installing while the WPS is running
    (which is most probably the case), WarpIN will show you
    confirmation dialogs about various files that are currently
    in use, most importantly, XFLDR.DLL. This is normal because
    those modules are loaded while the WPS (and thus XWorkplace)
    is running.

    In those dialogs, you MUST select "Unlock (DosReplaceModule)",
    or your installation will not be fully updated.

    If you get this message for a help file (.HLP extension), the
    XWorkplace help file is currently held open by the WPS.
    Unfortunately, with OS/2, it is impossible to unlock data files
    automatically. To unlock the help file, while the "locked"
    dialog is showing, simply open any standard WPS help panel
    (e.g. by clicking on an empty space on the desktop and
    pressing F1), which will unlock XWorkplace's help file.

    Besides, you will probably get a notification message that
    XWPDAEMN.EXE is running and must be killed. Have WarpIN kill
    that program (which is the XWorkplace Daemon).

    If upgrading doesn't work, have WarpIN remove the installed
    XWorkplace version first, restart the WPS, and install the
    new version then.


    Upgrading from XFolder
    ----------------------

    XWorkplace is the successor to XFolder (the last XFolder
    version was V0.85).

    XWorkplace and XFolder cannot coexist, since XWorkplace
    provides all the features of XFolder 0.85 plus many bugfixes
    and even more features.

    As a result, if XFolder is installed, XWorkplace will
    disable your XFolder installation.

    You should install XWorkplace to a directory OTHER than
    your existing XFolder directory to make sure no file
    conflicts occur. Several people have reported that
    installing to the same directory can hang your WPS.

    XWorkplace can take over your existing XFolder 0.85 settings,
    if present. You will be prompted for that during the first
    WPS restart after installation. However, many new settings
    have arrived, so many will be initially disabled.

    If you prefer to go back to your existing XFolder installation
    later (after all, this is a developer's release), have WarpIN
    de-install XWorkplace and install XFolder again, using
    INSTALL.CMD in your XFolder directory. Your old XFolder
    settings remain untouched by XWorkplace.


5. NATIONAL LANGUAGE SUPPORT
============================

    This archive contains XWorkplace National Language Support
    (NLS) for English only.

    However, XWorkplace is prepared for supporting additional
    languages via additional NLS packages, which are maintained
    and released by people other than me.

    Some are listed on www.xworkplace.org on the download page,
    but you will probably find more up-to-date information about
    NLS packages on the mailing lists (see CONTACT below).


6. GETTING STARTED
==================

    In any case, after installation, open the new "XWorkplace Setup"
    object first and go to the "Features" page. This is the most
    central place to enable XWorkplace features. Press the "Help"
    button there to get more information.


7. KNOWN LIMITATIONS
====================

    Please check the BUGS and FEATURES files in this package also
    before reporting bugs or suggesting features. Thank you.
