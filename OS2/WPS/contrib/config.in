# config.in:
#       this is included from setup.in only (and thus
#       indirectly by every makefile in this project).
#
#       The macros in this file replace the external
#       environment variables which were required
#       before V0.9.12.
#
#       The following variables MUST be set to match
#       your system. After this, XWP should compile
#       properly.
#
#       For details on these variables, see PROGREF.INF.
#
#       Note: You can still comment out everything in
#       this file and define all these variables
#       externally before calling nmake, since nmake
#       converts the entire environment to macros on
#       startup.

# CVS DIRECTORY SETUP

!ifndef CVS_WORK_ROOT

# name), unless you chose a different name.

# XWPHELPERSDIR: name of the directory the xwphelpers

# INCLUDE AND LIB SETUP
# ---------------------

# Starting with V0.9.12, we no longer use the default
# INCLUDE and LIB paths. Instead, we specify all
# directories directly on the command lines, so we
# need to know where your toolkit and compiler things
# are.

# TKBASE: the main Toolkit directory.
# This must be the parent of the "h" and "lib"
# directories with the include files and libraries.
!ifndef TKBASE
TKBASE = e:\Toolkit
!endif

# SMBASE: the main SOM directory.
# This is the parent of the "bin", "include" and "lib"
# directories containing the SOM compiler, include files
# and libraries. Normally, this would be $(TKBASE)\som.
# Change it if you're using the SOM compiler from another
# version of the Toolkit.
# @@added V1.0.9 (2011-09-05) [rwalsh]:
!ifndef SMBASE

# VACBASE: the main directory of your IBM
# VisualAge C++ installation. Both v3.0.8 and
# v3.6.5 should work.
# This must be the parent of the "include" and "lib"
# directories with the include files and libraries.
!ifndef VACBASE

# an explicit "nmake release".

# DEBUG CODE
# ----------

# XWP_DEBUG: set to YES if you want debug code;
# set to nothing if not.

# WARNING: Enabling debug code has side effects.
# See PROGREF.INF for details.

# If XWP_DEBUG is set to anything, the following is enabled:
#
# -- setup.in will change the compiler flags to produce debug
#    code. Otherwise, release code will be produced.
#
# -- __DEBUG__ will be #define'd in all source files.
#    include\setup.h reacts to that and redefines a number of
#    debugging macros.
#
# -- _Pmpf((...)) will be #define'd in the sources to produce
#    debug messages. YOU MUST HAVE THE PMPRINTF DLLs on your
#    LIBPATH then. See PROGREF.INF.

# XWP_DEBUG = YES

# MISCELLANEOUS
# -------------

# XWP_UNLOCK_MODULES: should be set to YES to
# automatically unlock files.
# Set this to nothing to disable unlocking.
XWP_UNLOCK_MODULES = YES

# XWP_LANG_CODE: language code of NLS resources
# to compile.
