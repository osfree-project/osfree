<B>Starting the build process.</B>
Starting with V0.9.12, this is a two-step process.
After opening a command line in the main XWorkplace directory
(the parent of <CODE>src</CODE> and <CODE>include</CODE>), do this:

<OL><LI>Run <CODE>nmake dep</CODE>. This examines all source files
for dependencies (<CODE>#include</CODE> statements) and writes a
<CODE>.depend</CODE> file into each source directory which is then
used by the makefiles to rebuild things properly.

<P><B>Note:</B> You only need to run <CODE>nmake dep</CODE> before building for
the first time, or if source dependencies (<CODE>#include</CODE> statements)
have changed. To be on the safe side, re-run <CODE>nmake dep</CODE> once
after you have checked out new sources from the CVS server.

<P><CODE>nmake dep</CODE> uses the fantastic <CODE>fastdep</CODE> utility by
Knut Stange Osmundsen, which I have stolen from the Odin sources. This should
be in the root directory of your <CODE>xwphelpers</CODE> repository.

<P><B>Note:</B> If you have never built XWorkplace before, <CODE>nmake dep</CODE>
will give you lots of warnings that headers could not be found. This is normal
because the SOM headers for the XWorkplace classes will only be produced during
the first full build.

<P><LI>After that, run either <CODE>nmake all</CODE> or <CODE>nmake really_all</CODE>
to build. This will produce lots of object files in <CODE>bin\</CODE> and
the executables in <CODE>bin\modules</CODE>. At the same time, those
executables are copied to the proper locations in your XWorkplace installation
directory as specified in <A HREF="src1_32env.html">config.in</A>.

<P>After that, restart the WPS to have <CODE>XFLDR.DLL</CODE> reloaded.

<P><CODE>nmake all</CODE> (or just <CODE>nmake</CODE>) will only rebuild
<CODE>XFLDR.DLL</CODE>, <CODE>XWPDAEMN.EXE</CODE>, and <CODE>XWPHOOK.DLL</CODE>,
while <CODE>nmake really_all</CODE> will produce the full set of XWorkplace
executables plus the NLS files.

</OL><B>Rebuilding the whole thing.</B> To rebuild everything, you have three
options:

<UL><LI>Delete the entire <CODE>bin\</CODE> tree. This is not part of the CVS
repository at Netlabs and recreated dynamically for all files that have been
created.
Deleting it will cause all target object files to become outdated and thus be recompiled,
which will then also invoke the linker.

<P><LI>Use <CODE>nmake -a</CODE> on the main makefile. This will even re-invoke
the SOM compiler on all <CODE>.IDL</CODE> files.

<P><LI>Open and save (or <CODE>touch</CODE>) <CODE>include/setup.h</CODE> to make
it newer than the target files. This is
<CODE>#include</CODE>'d in all XWorkplace C files, and the makefiles' inference
rules will then enforce recompilation of <I>all</I> C files.
