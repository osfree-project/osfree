<B>Note:</B> XWorkplace Security is currently a construction site and only built if the
<CODE>XWPSECURITY</CODE> <A HREF="src1_32env.html">environment variable</A> is set.

<P>XWorkplace Security (or XWPSec, in short) is supposed to become a framework and an
implementation for implementing local security on any OS/2 system. "Local security"
means that access control is enforced not only for network resources (which is what
a server does before passing out files etc. to a network client), but for any resources
that any running process tries to access.

<P>In this context, "resources" are mostly files and directories. In the future, this
might be extended to include printers and other hardware as well.

<P>If you have ever run Linux, you know that you have to log on before you can do anything
with the system. This is what XWPSec does as well. The current implementation consists
of the following:

<OL><LI><CODE>XWPSEC32.SYS</CODE>, a 32-bit ring-0 device driver which enforces access
control together with XWPShell. This requires OS/2 Security Enabling Services (SES) to
be installed. If you have an <CODE>\OS2\SECURITY</CODE> directory on your hard disk,
you have SES installed already. Otherwise run "Selective install" (and reinstall fixpaks).

<P><LI>"XWPShell", a wrapper around (and starter for) <CODE>PMSHELL.EXE</CODE>, the
WPS process. If this program is installed in <CODE>CONFIG.SYS</CODE> by changing
<CODE>SET RUNWORKPLACE=...XWPSHELL.EXE</CODE>, you will get a logon dialog after the
system has started up and PM has initialized.

<P>After entering a valid username and password, XWPShell will start the WPS, which can
be different for each user. This is done by changing the user profile (normally
<CODE>OS2.INI</CODE>), using <CODE>PrfReset</CODE>.

<P>XWPShell is really much more than a shell. It also communicates with the ring-0 driver
and maintains access control lists (ACLs) and logged-on users. For details, see below.

</OL>(Remark: With XWPSec, SES is <I>only</I> used with <CODE>XWPSEC32.SYS</CODE>.
If you are familiar with SES, note that XWPShell does not use SES Logon Shell Services (LSS).
In other words, XWPShell serves neither as an SES System Logon Authority (SLA) nor as a
User Identification Authority (UIA). This entire funtionality has been rewritten with
XWPShell becaues SES caused way too many problems. As a result, the <CODE>SECURE.SYS</CODE>
text file in <CODE>\OS2\SECURITY\SESDB</CODE> is not used either.)

<P>So how does this work?

<P>Basically, with OS/2, local security can be implemented by passing the OS/2 kernel
a table of "callouts", which are really hooks into the kernel. After the driver has
loaded, a number of <CODE>Dos*</CODE> API calls can be intercepted and, if desired,
rejected by the driver. For example, when an application calls <CODE>DosOpen</CODE>,
the driver can return <CODE>ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED</CODE>, and the application will not
be given access to the file.

<P>Of course, the driver needs to know when an application is supposed to gain access
to a resource. Since it is not a good idea to maintain access control lists (ACL's) at
ring-0, but we should rather keep the ring-0 code to a minimum, the driver communicates
with a ring-3 daemon thread in <CODE>XWPSHELL.EXE</CODE> to find out whether access should
be granted or denied.

<P>This basically works as follows:

<OL><LI>When XWPShell is started as the last step of <CODE>CONFIG.SYS</CODE> processing,
it initializes PM. It then starts a new thread (the "ring-3 daemon thread")
and contacts the ring-0 driver to tell it that access control should
be enforced from now on. (Until then, all access requests are granted to make sure none
of the processes started through <CODE>CONFIG.SYS</CODE> fail.)

<P>Together with the call into the driver, the daemon thread passes a block of memory
which is needed for exchanging data with the driver.

<P>(Of course, XWPShell also displays the logon dialog and starts the WPS, but this is
another issue.)

<P><LI>The driver blocks the ring-3 daemon thread. To the daemon thread, it just looks
like it has made a function call into the driver which can take a very long time.

<P><LI>When an access request (e.g. <CODE>DosOpen</CODE>) is intercepted by the driver,
which is then running at task time of the process which issued the call,
the driver unblocks the ring-3 daemon thread and passes it information about the
access request. To the daemon, this looks like the function call returns, and the data
buffer passed to the driver has been filled with information about the access request.

<P><LI>The ring-3 daemon thread then looks up the user ID and group ID for the process
on which the driver was called. XWPShell maintains a list of all running processes and
associates a user ID and group ID with each of them. As a result, each process can have
different access rights.

<P><LI>The ring-3 daemon thread then looks up whether the user on whose behalf the process
is running is allowed to gain access to the resource (e.g. file or directory). For example,
for opening a file for writing, the user needs write access to both the file and the
directory in which the file resides. XWPShell maintains access control lists for each
directory and/or file, and it does this in Unix style.
See <CODE>src\XWPShell\acldb.c</CODE> for an introduction.

<P>If no information for the user ID is found, XWPShell searches again with the group
ID of the user.

<P>If no information for the group ID is found either, XWPShell denies access.

<P><LI>The ring-3 daemon in XWPShell calls back into the driver with the result of the
access check, which is returned to the OS/2 kernel as <CODE>NO_ERROR</CODE> or
<CODE>ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED</CODE>. The ring-3 daemon thread is then blocked again
until the next request comes in. Go back to 3.
