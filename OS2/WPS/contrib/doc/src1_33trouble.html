<OL><LI>If you get errors from the <B>makefiles,</B> make sure you have set up
<A HREF="src1_32env.html">config.in</A> correctly.

<P><LI>In addition, if you have just checked out and the sources complain
about ".depend" not found or a missing header file, run <code>nmake dep</code>.
This is required before the first make anyway, but sometimes, if header files
get renamed or removed, another <code>nmake dep</code> is required. It is
good practice to run this once after every checkout.

<P><LI>Same thing if the compiler cannot find an include file, or the linker
cannot find libraries.

<P><LI>Make sure your <CODE>TEMP</CODE>, <CODE>TMP</CODE>, and <CODE>TMPDIR</CODE>
directories are set correctly. Most importantly, when using <CODE>RAMFS.IFS</CODE>,
do not use a root directory because apparently RC chokes on that. I have the following
in <CODE>CONFIG.SYS</CODE>:

<PRE>
IFS=J:\common\ifs\RAMFS64.IFS
CALL=J:\common\ifs\RAMDISK.EXE Z:
RUN=I:\OS2\CMD.EXE /C md Z:\temp
SET TMP=Z:\temp
SET TEMP=Z:\temp
SET TMPDIR=Z:\temp
</PRE>

<P><LI>Also, you need to check out the "xwphelpers" CVS archive from Netlabs for the
<A HREF="src1_5helpers.html">helpers</A> code. Make sure that this code
is not outdated (I usually update it together with the main XWorkplace code).

<P>Same thing if you get unknown definitions or unresolved externals during
compiling/linking. This is most probably due to outdated helpers.

<P><LI>If the SOM compiler chokes on the <CODE>.IDL</CODE> files, you may
have a problem with the <CODE>nmake</CODE> version that is running. Several
people have reported that the <CODE>nmake</CODE> that comes with the Warp 4.5
Toolkit does not set <CODE>SMINCLUDE</CODE> correctly from the makefiles.
I am still running <CODE>nmake</CODE> 3, which comes with the Warp 3 Toolkit
and also with the IBM VAC 3 compiler.

<P>Alternatively, look at <CODE>idl\makefile</CODE> and search for
<CODE>SMINCLUDE</CODE>. Uncomment the line that sets the environment variable
and set the variable to the proper values externally. Some people have
gotten the thing to work like that too.

<P>The SOM compiler that comes with some versions of the Warp 4.5 Toolkit
appears to produce
very strange errors also, according to some user reports. I recommend using
the Warp 3 Toolkit; see <A HREF="src1_2requires.html">Required Tools</A>.

<P><LI>If you get unresolved externals while linking the XCenter widgets, take
a look at <CODE>src\shared\xwp.def</CODE>, which exports the functions from
XFLDR.DLL.

<P><LI>If you get something like <B>"File XWPDAEMN.EXE/XWPHOOK.DLL is in use",</B>
use WatchCat or some other process killer to kill <CODE>XWPDAEMN.EXE</CODE>, which
will automatically unload the hook DLL. Then, after the build, restart the daemon
by executing <CODE>XWPDAEMN -D</CODE> (to circumvent the error message box which
comes up otherwise).

<P>See <A HREF="src1_32env.html">config.in</A> for details.

<P><LI>If you get really strange compilation errors, VAC might have gotten confused
with precompiled headers. Delete all <CODE>.PCH</CODE> files in your TEMP directory,
or comment out the <CODE>PRECH</CODE> line in <CODE>setup.in</CODE> to disable
precompiled headers altogether. I have also found that killing <CODE>DDE4LOAD.EXE</CODE>
(the VAC background process) helps sometimes, for whatever reason.

<P><LI>If you <B>cannot install XWorkplace</B> after the build or, after the WPS
restart, none of the XWorkplace classes seem to be loaded, you have probably built
the debug version, but the PMPRINTF DLLs are not on your LIBPATH.
<B>Do not build the debug version if you haven't downloaded PMPRINTF yet.</B>
See <A HREF="src1_880debug.html">"Debugging"</A> for details.
