XWorkplace uses two kinds of settings: global and instance settings.

<P>The <B>global settings</B> are set both in the &quot;Workplace Shell&quot; object and
on the &quot;XDesktop&quot; notebook page and are stored in the &quot;XWorkplace&quot; app
in <CODE>OS2.INI</CODE>. All the global notebook logic is in <CODE>src\shared\notebook.c</CODE>.

<P>Note that the large structure called
<CODE>GLOBALSETTINGS</CODE> that was used from XFolder 0.1 until XWorkplace 0.9.16 is
gone now. Yes, it almost broke my heart, but I got sick of it. Instead, global settings
are implemented via <CODE>cmnQuerySetting</CODE> and <CODE>cmnSetSetting</CODE> in
<CODE>src\shared\common.c</CODE> now.

<P>By contrast, the <B>individual object settings</B> are stored in
instance data, which is declared in the <CODE>.IDL</CODE> files. Most of these are
stored and retrieved using the normal WPS mechanism
(<CODE>wpSaveDeferred</CODE>/<CODE>wpRestoreData</CODE>) and can have
a certain &quot;transparent&quot;
value, which means that the global setting is to be used instead.
