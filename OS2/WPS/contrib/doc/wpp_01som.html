In general, XWorkplace is pretty straightforward SOM/WPS code. It
overrides a lot of <CODE>wp*</CODE> and <CODE>wpcls*</CODE> methods.

<P>In order to avoid too much
confusion, the methods which XWorkplace <I>adds</I> do not carry
the usual <CODE>wp*</CODE> and
<CODE>wpcls*</CODE> prefixes, but
<CODE>xwp*</CODE> and <CODE>xwpcls*</CODE> instead.
Only "real" XWorkplace SOM methods have this prefix; "normal" functions have other
prefixes (see the <A HREF="src1_801prefixes.html">previous page</A> for a list).

<P>As XWorkplace became more complex over time, I have delved quite deeply
into SOM. While I still don't fully understand what is going on in
the SOM kernel (from what I hear, I guess nobody does) and some bugs
in there keep puzzling me, I've found out some interesting stuff.

<P><B>Note:</B> The following is not required to write WPS classes. This
is additional information for those who have written WPS classes already
and might be interested in some SOM internals.
<P>
Most of this is related to the <B>&quot;WPS Classes&quot;</B> object
(<CODE>xclslist.c</CODE>).
The SOM logic for this is in
<CODE>classlst.c</CODE> in <CODE>clsWPSClasses2Cnr</CODE>,
which can analyze the current SOM runtime environment (which is that
of the WPS), i.e. all the classes that have been loaded and query their
inheritance hierarchy at runtime.
<P>This inserts the WPS class tree as
recordcores into a given cnr control. This works with any containers
in tree views, so that some XWorkplace dialogs can use this too. Check
the sources, there's some interesting stuff.
<P>
Note that there are quite a number of functions in XWorkplace which take
SOM (WPS) objects as a parameter, even though they are not <B>SOM methods.</B>
See <CODE>src\shared\wpsh.c</CODE> for examples. The reason for this is that
resolving SOM methods takes quite a bit of time, and calling regular
functions will work just as well, but faster.
<P>
If you look into the <CODE>.IH</CODE> header files created by the SOM
compiler, you see that the C bindings for method calls are really all
macros #define'd in the header files which translate into more complex
C code.
<P>Here's an example: if you call
<CODE>_wpQueryStyle(somSelf)</CODE> in <CODE>xfldr.c</CODE>, where this
method has not been overridden, the WPObject version of this method should
get called. Here's the #define in <CODE>xfldr.ih</CODE> for this:
<P><CODE>#define XFolder_wpQueryStyle WPObject_wpQueryStyle</CODE>

<P>And <CODE>WPObject_wpQueryStyle</CODE> is #define'd in <CODE>wpobject.h</CODE> from
the toolkit headers as follows:

<PRE>
#define WPObject_wpQueryStyle(somSelf) \
    (SOM_Resolve(somSelf, WPObject, wpQueryStyle) \
    (somSelf))
</PRE>
Actually, there are more macros related to this, but this is the important one.
<CODE>SOM_Resolve</CODE> in turn is a macro #define'd in <CODE>somcdev.h</CODE>,
which calls the SOM kernel function <CODE>somResolve</CODE>. That function
finally goes through the class method tables to find the actual function
address and call it.
<P>
As as result, not only does compiling of SOM code take ages (because of all the
nested macros), but also <I>calling</I> SOM methods does, because as opposed
to "static" OO languages such as C++, method resolution is occuring at
run-time. IBM says in the SOM docs that
<B>calling a SOM method takes at least three times as long as calling a normal C
function.</B>
<P>
Since there is no real need to write functions as SOM methods, except when you
want to design a method which can be overriden in subclasses,
I have only done so
in rare occasions to speed up processing.
<P>
Here are some <B>other SOM tricks and functions</B> which are not mentioned directly
in the WPS reference (but only in the chaotic SOM docs), but these are
very useful. Some of this is pretty basic, some might be new to WPS programmers,
so I'll list this here:

<UL><LI>Since all the SOM stuff is declared in those huge header files, you
need to <B>#include a header file</B> if you need access to certain class-specific
features.
<P>For example, if you write a subclass of WPDataFile and need some
program-object method call (e.g. <CODE>_wpQueryProgDetails</CODE>), you need
to put <CODE>#include &lt;wppgm.h&gt;</CODE> on top of your code, or the
method binding will not be found.
<P>This is not neccessary if the method is defined for a superclass of your
class, because the SOM headers automatically #include all the parent classes.
That is, for example,
you don't need to #include <CODE>wpfsys.h</CODE> (for WPFileSystem)
for your WPDataFile subclass.

<P><LI>The most important thing to keep in mind is that all <B>SOM classes are
objects</B> too. They are instances of their respective metaclasses. This takes some
getting used to, but it is this concept only which allows WPS classes to
be created at runtime and for class replacements in the first place.
<P>That is, for example, any Desktop object is an instance of WPObject (really
one of its subclasses). The WPObject class in turn is an instance of
its metaclass, M_WPObject.
<P>In SOM, the default metaclass for a class is SOMClass. However, the WPS
overrides this behavior to create a unique metaclass for each WPS class,
which is prefixed with <CODE>M_</CODE>. Since the metaclass is a class as well,
it has methods too (the so-called "class methods", which operate on class
objects, as opposed to the "instance methods" of the class itself, which operate
on instances of the class -- the Desktop objects).

<P><LI>To <B>access a class object,</B> for any existing class you always have a
corresponding macro which is
an underscore plus the class name. That is, the class object of WPObject
can always be obtained with <CODE>_WPObject</CODE>. This is useful for calling
class methods, which always need to be invoked on a class object. So, to call
a folder class method, you do something like
<CODE>_wpclsQueryOpenFolders(_WPFolder)</CODE>.
<P>
Note: If a class has been replaced, the macro will not return the original, but
the replacement class. That is, if XWorkplace is installed, the above example
would actually return the XFldObject class object (see notes below), and methods
invoked on the WPObject class object would actually be resolved for XFldObject.
That's how class replacements work in the first place. See the notes below for more.

<P><LI><CODE>BOOL _somIsA(pObject, pClassObject)</CODE> checks for whether
pObject is an <B>instance of the class</B> specified by pClassObject or one of
its subclasses.
This is extensively used in <CODE>statbars.c</CODE> to
adjust status bar display depending on the class of a single object which
is currently selected.
<P>Example: <CODE>_somIsA(somSelf, _WPObject)</CODE> should always be true within
the WPS context, since all WPS classes are subclasses of WPObject.
By contrast, <CODE>_somIsA(somSelf, _WPFolder)</CODE> would only return TRUE if somSelf
is a WPS folder. (This would work with <CODE>_XFolder</CODE> too, but this would
require that you have access to the XFolder header files and that XFolder replaces
WPFolder. <CODE>_WPFolder</CODE> always works, even if WPFolder is replaced,
because <CODE>_WPFolder</CODE> would be resolved to point to the replacement class object
then -- e.g. <CODE>_XFolder</CODE>.)

<P><LI><CODE>PSZ _somGetName(pClassObject)</CODE> returns the
<B>class name</B> specified by pClassObject, as specified in the IDL file.
(That is different from <CODE>wpclsQueryTitle</CODE>.)
<P>Example: <CODE>_somGetName(_XFldObject)</CODE> will return "XFldObject".

<P><LI><CODE>SOMClass* _somGetParent(pClassObject)</CODE> returns a
<B>parent class.</B>
<P>Examples: <CODE>_somGetParent(_WPProgram)</CODE> returns the WPAbstract
class object (<CODE>_WPAbstract</CODE>).
<CODE>_somGetParent(_XFolder)</CODE> should return <CODE>_WPFolder</CODE>,
unless there's some other WPFolder replacement class above XWorkplace in the
replacement list.

<P><LI><CODE>BOOL _somDescendedFrom(pClass, pClassParent)</CODE> returns TRUE
if pClass is <B>descended</B> from pClassParent.
<P>Examples: <CODE>_somDescendedFrom(_WPFolder, _WPObject)</CODE> should return
TRUE. <CODE>_somDescendedFrom(_WPFolder, _WPProgram)</CODE> would return FALSE.

<P><LI><CODE>somResolveByName(pClassObject, "method")</CODE> gives you
a <B>function pointer</B> as implemented by the specified class. You should assign
this to a function pointer variable which matches the function prototype,
or otherwise you'll get crashes. This can be useful if you invoke a SOM method
frequently, for example in a loop on many objects, because then SOM method resolution
has to be done only once. If you used the macros, resolution would take place
for each iteration in the loop.

<P><LI><B>Class replacements.</B> Nowhere is really documented how class
replacements actually work, except that replacement classes must be direct
descendants of the class which is to be replaced. I assume that class
replacements are a feature of the SOM class manager, of which the WPS
class manager is a descendant (WPClassManager is half documented in the
WPS Reference.) At least there is a documented SOMClassMgr
method, <CODE>somSubstituteClass</CODE>, which appears to be doing exactly
this job.
<P>From what I've seen, class replacements seem to work this way: Any time a class object
is queried, the class manager does not return the class object of the
specified class, but the object of the replacement class instead. As a result, all
the method calls are not resolved for the original class, but for the replacement
class instead.
<P>Examples: If XFolder replaces WPFolder,
<CODE>wpModifyPopupMenu</CODE> is not called for WPFolder,
but for XFolder instead, even though the WPS had originally called it for a folder object.
By contrast, for <CODE>wpQueryIcon</CODE>, which is not overridden by XFolder, method
resolution leads to the method as implemented by the parent class, which should
be WPFolder, unless some other class replacements is present.
<P>The class replacement mechanism
is most obvious with the class object macros described above: if
you have a <CODE>_WPFolder</CODE> in your code, this returns the class object
of XFolder, i.e. <CODE>_WPFolder == _XWorkplace</CODE>. So if you absolutely need
the WPFolder class object (which is normally not necessary, since this would
circumvent XFolder's functionality), you use <CODE>_WPFolder</CODE> (which
returns the XFolder class object) and then
climb up the class object's inheritance tree using
<CODE>_somGetParent</CODE> until <CODE>_somGetName</CODE> returns "WPFolder".

<P><LI>To get the class object of any class without having access to its
header files, do the following:
<PRE>
somId    somidThis = somIdFromString("WPObject");
SOMClass *pClassObject = _somFindClass(SOMClassMgrObject, somidThis, 0, 0);
</PRE>
Note again that <CODE>_somFindClass</CODE> will return replacement classes
instead of the originals. (That's how the class object macros work, BTW.)

<P><LI><CODE>__get_somRegisteredClasses(SOMClassMgrObject)</CODE> returns a
<CODE>SOMClassSequence</CODE> of all currently registered class objects. This
is used by the "WPS classes" page in the "Workplace Shell" object. See
<CODE>classlst.c</CODE> for details.
