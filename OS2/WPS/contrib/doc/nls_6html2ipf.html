The h2i Utility

<BODY TEXT="#000000" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" LINK="#0000AA" VLINK="#777777">

Older versions of XFolder and XWorkplace used the very valuable <CODE>html2ipf.cmd</CODE>
script by Andrew Pavel Zabolotny which has served me quite well over the years.
However, this has now been replaced with my own
<CODE>h2i.exe</CODE> utility, which is both faster and more flexible.

<P><CODE>h2i</CODE> is contained in the <CODE>xwphelpers</CODE> repository
at netlabs (see <A HREF="nls_2requires.html">"Requirements"</A>).
Start <CODE>h2i</CODE> to
have its syntax explained. It works quite similar to <CODE>html2ipf.cmd</CODE>,
so you can also check <CODE>HTML2IPF.INF</CODE> for the general principle.

<P>In addition, <CODE>h2i</CODE> supports the following:
<UL>
<LI>The <CODE>&lt;HTML&gt;</CODE> tag has new attributes:
<CODE>XPOS=</CODE> and
<CODE>YPOS=</CODE> work just like
IPF's &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; tags;
<CODE>WIDTH=</CODE> and
<CODE>HEIGHT=</CODE> are the same as in IPF.

<P><LI>The <CODE>&lt;A&gt;</CODE> tag accepts a new
<CODE>AUTO=</CODE> attribute, which works just like
<CODE>HREF=</CODE>, but automatically opens and closes the window (this is, for
example, used on the &quot;Introduction&quot; page of the
<I>XWorkplace Online Reference</I>).

<P><LI>The <CODE>&lt;CITE&gt;</CODE> and
<CODE>&lt;/CITE&gt;</CODE> formatting tags are now set to use a
non-proportional font, which is used extensively.

<P><LI>Some formatting changes (<CODE>&lt;UL&gt;</CODE>, <CODE>&lt;BR&gt;</CODE>,
<CODE>&lt;B&gt;</CODE> etc.).

<P><LI>As opposed to <CODE>html2ipf</CODE>, <CODE>h2i</CODE> supports the <CODE>resid</CODE>
attribute to the <CODE>&lt;HTML&gt;</CODE> tag to allow setting the resid explicitly,
which is very
helpful for composing help panels that can actually get called by ID from XWorkplace.

<P><LI>In addition, <CODE>h2i</CODE> supports string replacements via <B>entities</B>.
An entity always has the form <CODE>&amp;entity;</CODE> and whatever is between
the "&amp;" and and ";" characters can be dynamically replaced. Since <CODE>h2i</CODE>
can also parse C include files for C preprocessor <CODE>#define</CODE>'s, this
allows for including the same headers in XWorkplace and <CODE>h2i</CODE> to share
definitions and resids.

<P><LI>Finally, <CODE>h2i</CODE> supports the new <CODE>&lt;IFDEF&gt;</CODE> and
<CODE>&lt;IFNDEF&gt;</CODE> tags for conditional compiles.
