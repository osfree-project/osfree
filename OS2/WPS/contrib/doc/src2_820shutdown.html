XShutdown (i.e. the &quot;eXtended Shutdown&quot; and &quot;Restart Desktop&quot; features)
resides entirely in the <CODE>src\startshut\shutdown.c</CODE> file.
<P>
XShutdown starts two additional threads to close all the windows. This is described
in detail in the "XWorkplace Internals" section of the <I>XWorkplace User Guide</I>.
I have also tried to put plenty of comments into the sources.
