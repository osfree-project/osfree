National Language Support (NLS) is done by separating everything that
is language-dependent from the actual program logic. The way XWorkplace
does this is that all the NLS stuff is packaged into files that are
completely separate from <CODE>XFLDR.DLL</CODE> so you can change XWorkplace's
language without having to recompile XWorkplace itself.

<P>XWorkplace NLS packages identify themselves to the XWorkplace core via
<B>country codes,</B> as described on the &quot;COUNTRY&quot; page in the
<I>OS/2 Command Reference</I> (CMDREF.INF).

<P>XWorkplace's language depends on exactly one setting in OS2.INI (application
"XWorkplace", key "LanguageCode"). If that setting is changed, XWorkplace assumes a
whole new set of language files to be present. The setting is only checked once
at WPS startup or later if you explicitly load a new language in the
XWorkplace Setup object. If no code is present, "001" for US English is assumed.

<P>The XWorkplace sources contain everything for creating the US English
NLS package, as it comes with the standard XWorkplace binary release.
The language code for US English is &quot;001&quot;. Everything that is related
to English NLS is therefore in the <CODE>001\</CODE> directory tree.

<P>The <B>first step</B> you'll have to take is finding out your country
code. For example, Italian would be 039.

<P>Unfortunately, XWorkplace's National Language Support (NLS) is spread across quite
a number of files, which have different file formats.

<P>Basically, XWorkplace's NLS can be separated into three parts:

<OL><LI><B>Run-time NLS:</B> this is all the language-dependent
things that XWorkplace will ever display to the user, such as menus,
dialogs, messages, and notebook pages.
<P>Here we have:

<BR><UL><LI>The <B>NLS DLL</B> to be put into the XWorkplace <CODE>bin</CODE>
subdirectory.
This file contains all language-dependent Presentation Manager (PM) resources,
mostly dialogs and menus. Also, a lot of strings are stored here.
<P>The NLS DLL is called <CODE>xfldrXXX.dll</CODE>, with &quot;xxx&quot; being your
three-digit language code.
The files neccessary to translate this DLL are in the <CODE>001\dll</CODE>
directory. All this goes into <CODE>bin\xfldr001.dll</CODE> in the binary
release.
<P>See <A HREF="nls_4dll.html">"The main NLS DLL"</A> for details.

<P><LI>The XWorkplace <B>message file</B>, <CODE>help\xfldrXXX.tmf</CODE>.
This file holds all kinds of messages which
are mostly displayed in XWorkplace's message boxes and are too large to be put into
the resources of the NLS DLL (because PM string resources are limited to 256
characters, unfortunately).
<P>The file has a format similar to that of the source files for the
IBM <CODE>MKMSGF.EXE</CODE> utility, but using that utility is not necessary
for XWorkplace.
There are several <CODE>*.tmf</CODE> files in the <CODE>001\misc</CODE>
directory in the sources, which are combined to form
<CODE>help\xfldr001.tmf</CODE> in the binary release.
<P>See <A HREF="nls_7misc.html">"Other files"</A> for details.

<!-- changed V1.0.6: the "WPS Classes" settings page has been moved to
                     the "WPS Class List" object -->
<P><LI>The <B>WPS class descriptions</B> which are displayed in the
&quot;WPS Class List&quot; object. This was introduced
with XFolder 0.80 also.
<P>This file is called <CODE>XFCLSxxx.TXT</CODE>, with &quot;xxx&quot; being your
three-digit language code. It also resides in the <CODE>001\misc</CODE> directory.
<P>See <A HREF="nls_7misc.html">"Other files"</A> for details.

<P><LI>The <B>Driver descriptions</B> which are displayed on the &quot;Drivers&quot;
page of the &quot;OS/2 Kernel&quot; object.
<P>This file is called <CODE>DRVRSxxx.TXT</CODE>, with &quot;xxx&quot; being your
three-digit language code. It also resides in the <CODE>001\misc</CODE> directory.
<P>See <A HREF="nls_7misc.html">"Other files"</A> for details.

<P><LI>A number of REXX .CMD and text files for XWorkplace's installation.
The files to be translated are in the <CODE>001\misc</CODE> subdirectory
and go into <CODE>install\</CODE> in the binary release.
<P>See <A HREF="nls_7misc.html">"Other files"</A> for details.

<!-- V1.0.6: added READMEs -->
</UL><BR><LI><B>Documentation:</B> the READMEs, the XWorkplace User Guide (INF file), and online
help (HLP file). This is not absolutely necessary and probably the larger
part of the translation work, since I have written so much text over time.

<P>Here we have:

<!-- V1.0.6: added READMEs item -->
<BR><UL><LI>The <B>README</B> files in the XWorkplace main directory.
<P>These are called <B>readme</B> and <B>readme.nls</B>. While the former contains
general information about XWorkplace, the latter should deal with the NLS
package only. They are located in the <CODE>001</CODE> directory.

<P><LI>The <B>XWorkplace Online Reference (INF)</B> in the XWorkplace main directory.
<P>This file is called <CODE>xfldrXXX.inf</CODE>, with &quot;xxx&quot; being your
three-digit language code.
The HTML source files neccessary to translate this file are in the <CODE>001/inf.001</CODE>
subdirectory.
<P>See <A HREF="nls_5infhlp.html">"The INF and HLP files"</A> for details.

<P><LI>The <B>XWorkplace HLP file</B> in the HELP subdirectory. This file holds
all the help panels that are displayed when you press F1.
<P>This file is called <CODE>xfldrXXX.hlp</CODE>, with &quot;xxx&quot; being your
three-digit language code.
The files neccessary to translate this file are in the <CODE>001/xwphelp2</CODE>
subdirectory.
<P>See <A HREF="nls_5infhlp.html">"The INF and HLP files"</A> for details.

<P>(Yes, I know the directory naming conventions might seem strange, but if you
have ever tried to rename a directory with CVS, you will understand.)

</UL><BR><LI><B>Installation:</B> a number of files which are only used while
XWorkplace is being installed. These set up XWorkplace objects and INI keys
in a certain language. Please see the README in the <CODE>MISC</CODE>
directory for details.

<P><LI>The Warp 4 SmartGuide script which was present with XFolder and XWorkplace
before V0.9.7 is gone now.
