Once you have created and successfully tested your NLS package, you should
create a WarpIN package to make it available to other users. The XWorkplace
build environment can do some of this for you but not everything.

<P>To create a WarpIN archive:

<UL><LI>Open the <CODE>MAKEWPIxxx.CMD</CODE> file in your NLS directory tree
and change the country codes as per the included instructions. This file is
later called to create the archive.

<P><LI>Open the <CODE>NLSxxx.WIS</CODE> file. This is the WarpIN script
that tells WarpIN what to do with the included files. Translate and
adapt it as per the included instructions. Every location that has to
be changed is preceded by an explanatory comment.

<P><LI>Open a command line window in the root
directory of your XWorkplace tree and issue the following command:

<P><CODE>nmake wpi_nls</CODE>

<P>This should copy a number of files and then invoke WarpIN. You will
see some messages about added files and compression rates.

<P><LI>Now test the archive by installing it. If WarpIN finishes the
installation without errors switch to your language and see if
everything works correctly.
</UL>

<P>If everything works correctly, don't forget to tell the XWorkplace
maintainers about it so your changes can be committed to CVS!
