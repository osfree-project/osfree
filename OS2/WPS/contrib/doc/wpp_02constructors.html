    Simulating Copy Constructors With SOM

Instance data comes in extremely handy with WPS classes and is used throughout
XWorkplace also. In all WPS programming docs and tutorials I've seen, you are taught
to declare your instance data in the IDL file, initialize it in <CODE>wpInitData</CODE>,
store it in <CODE>wpSaveState</CODE>, restore it in <CODE>wpRestoreState</CODE>,
and clean up in <CODE>wpUnInitData</CODE>.

<P>However, if your instance data
consists of pointers to variable data which is allocated somewhere in the
class's implementation (e.g. in <CODE>wpInitData</CODE>), great care must be
taken to maintain data integrity.

<P>When objects are copied, SOM per default does a so-called "shallow copy"
of the object's instance data. That is, the binary instance data is simply
copied to the new object. (From what I've seen, this is done by the
<CODE>SOMObject::somDefaultConstAssign</CODE>
method, which apparently is not overridden by any WPS class).

<P>This is very dangerous for pointers because you then have two objects pointing
to the same memory block. If one of the objects is then deleted and frees its
storage (e.g. in <CODE>wpUnInitData</CODE>), the other object's member pointer
points to storage which has been freed.

<P>This problem is a common one with C++ programming, and there you have the
concept of copy constructors to take it into account.
Unfortunately, the WPS docs never even mention this problem, even though the
WPS programmers have most obviously been aware of it, since WPS methods exist
to solve this.

<P>From my checking, there are two
possible solutions to this problem:

<UL><LI>Override <CODE>wpObjectReady</CODE>. When objects are copied in any way
(either through <CODE>wpCopyObject</CODE> or <CODE>wpCreateFromTemplate</CODE>
or <CODE>wpCreateAnother</CODE>),
the <CODE>ulCode</CODE> parameter has the <CODE>OR_REFERENCE</CODE> bit set.
Then allocate a second buffer, copy the buffer data from the source object there
and adjust your member pointer.

<P>When an object is copied, from my testing, <CODE>wpObjectReady</CODE> gets called
from <CODE>wpCopyObject</CODE> right before that method returns. See the
<A HREF="wpp_03copydata.html">"Drag-copy trace session"</A> for details.

<P><LI>Override <CODE>wpCopyObject</CODE>, <CODE>wpCreateFromTemplate</CODE>,
and <CODE>wpCreateAnother</CODE>
and do these things there. Call the parent first and adjust the data before returning.
This will be a bit later, but still work.

</UL>I have checked some of the method tables (use the "WPS Class List" object to
see yourself) and seen that many WPS classes override just these three methods
(for example WPProgram, which most probably operates with pointers to store the
program data which is variable in length).
It is at least interesting to see that the WPS classes appear to use this approach,
but not a word about this is said in the WPS docs...
