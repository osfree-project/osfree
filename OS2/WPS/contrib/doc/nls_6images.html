The images in both the INF and HELP directory are in GIF format.
Unfortunately, HTML does not support the OS/2 BMP format, and <CODE>ipfc</CODE>
does not support GIF.

<P>So the makefiles in INF and HELP automatically convert all GIF images to
BMP format, if required. This requires <CODE>gbmsize.exe</CODE> to be on your PATH
(see <A HREF="nls_2requires.html">"Requirements"</A>)

<P>If you do not want to use <CODE>gbmsize</CODE>, you can convert all the
GIFs to BMPs manually, e.g. using PMView.
Be careful though: <B>IPFC only supports uncompressed OS/2 1.3 bitmaps.</B>
That is, neither compressed bitmaps nor Windows or OS/2 2.0 bitmaps work.
This is annoying, because IPFC's own image compression is totally outdated,
but there's nothing we can do about this.

<P>I'd be very grateful if you could create your own screenshots
for the online documentation to reflect your language.

<P>I have used the following settings for the screenshots (just for your
information, you don't have to use these):

<PRE>

Fonts used:
Titlebars: Humanist 521, 13 points (available on the
           CorelDraw 4 CD in Type 1 format)
All the other fonts are set to 9.WarpSans.

CandyBarZ installed, colors:
Active:     top 191/0/0, bottom 52/0/0
Inactive:   top 160/160/130, bottom 40/40/40

Oh yes, XWorkplace installed. ;-)
</PRE>

Now, if you create your own screenshots, save them as GIFs with the
exact filenames of the originals (e.g. <CODE>trunc.gif</CODE>); you must then
DELETE the respective BMP file, because HTML2IPF will only call the
image converter for BMP if no BMP file of the same name exists.
<P>
<B>Tricks to reduce file sizes:</B>
<P>
Keep in mind that HLP/INF files have their own compression scheme which
works best when much redundant data is in the bitmap files. For those who know
what that is: IPFC compresses using a modified Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm
(similar to the GIF format).
In plain English, large areas which have the same color can be compressed best.

<P>This leads to the following recommendations:
<UL><LI>Do not take screenshots of folders with background bitmaps. There will
be practically no compression on those.
<P><LI>Use as few colors as possible. You can use PMView to reduce the number
of colors to, say, 12 colors, which usually still looks alright.
<P><LI>When converting images, make
sure you don't have &quot;dithering&quot; or &quot;error diffusion&quot; enabled, because
this will add lots of extra pixels which will make compression less
efficient.
<P><LI>Also, if you need to scale images to a smaller size, make sure not to
enable any "interpolation", i.e. introducing extra pixels to make colors smoother.
This adds lots more colors to the file, which cannot be compressed well either.
