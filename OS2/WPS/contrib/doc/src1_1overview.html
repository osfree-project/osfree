Before going into the details of source code, which is complex enough to get
even the more experienced programmer confused,
<B>please read the chapters in the &quot;XWorkplace internals&quot; chapter
of the XWorkplace Online reference</B> for a first introduction to XWorkplace's basic
inner workings.
<P>This will give you a vague idea of what XWorkplace is doing where
and deals with the most important concepts only, so you don't get
overwhelmed by all the details which come in this file.
<P>
The different <B>subdirectories</B> contain the different parts of XWorkplace.
The layout of the subdirectories has been changed with XWorkplace V0.9.0 to
allow for easier addition of new features by people other than me. Also,
since XWorkplace will be on the Netlabs CVS server, many changes had to be
made to the makefiles and code layout.
<!-- V1.0.6: added other languages -->
<UL><LI>
The <CODE>001\</CODE> directory tree still contains all the
<A HREF="040nls.html">National Language Support (NLS)</A>
for English. Likewise, other directories with three-digit names contain NLS
for other languages.

<P><LI>The <CODE>BIN\</CODE> directory tree contains binary object files which
are created from the sources (below) by the various makefiles. If that
directory doesn't exist (it's not part of the CVS tree, for many reasons),
it will be created automatically by the makefiles.

<P>The directory structure and the makefiles are designed to not depend on the
<CODE>BIN</CODE> directory tree. As
a result, you can always delete the entire <CODE>BIN</CODE>
directory or any single files in there to enforce a complete or partial recompilation
by the makefiles.

<!-- V1.0.6: added the following item -->
<P><LI>The <CODE>DOC\</CODE> directory contains the HTML source files for this
INF file.

<P><LI>The <CODE>IDL\</CODE> directory contains SOM IDL source files for
the various XWorkplace classes. The <CODE>.DEF</CODE> files in this
directory are created automatically by the SOM compiler (<CODE>SC.EXE</CODE>),
but not used in the build process (see below).
<P>When invoked by the
makefile, the SOM compiler is told to update the C sources in <CODE>SRC\CLASSES</CODE>
and write the class header files (<CODE>*.h</CODE>, <CODE>*.ih</CODE>) to
<CODE>INCLUDE\CLASSES</CODE>.
<P>In general, all SOM code should be in the <CODE>CLASSES</CODE> subdirectories.
Since several people might be working on the same classes, the code in
<CODE>CLASSES</CODE> should only call implementation
code in other directories of <CODE>SRC</CODE>, which should be prototyped in
a corresponding subdirectory of <CODE>INCLUDE</CODE>.

<P><LI>The <CODE>INCLUDE\</CODE> directory tree has all the headers for
XWorkplace.
<P>In that tree, <CODE>INCLUDE\CLASSES\</CODE> has the headers which are
generated by the SOM compiler from the IDL files in the <CODE>IDL</CODE>
directory (above). There is no hand-written code in that directory.
<P><CODE>INCLUDE\HELPERS\</CODE> has the headers for the files in <CODE>SRC\HELPERS\</CODE>
(see below).
<B>Note:</B> This is now in a separate CVS archive on Netlabs, which is called
"xwphelpers". You need to check out that archive to be able to compile.

<P><CODE>INCLUDE\FILESYS\</CODE> has the headers for the files in <CODE>SRC\FILESYS\</CODE>
(see below).
<P><CODE>INCLUDE\SHARED\</CODE> has headers for code which might be used by several
parts of XWorkplace, developed by several people, and corresponds to
<CODE>SRC\SHARED</CODE>. I guess you get the idea now.

<!-- V1.0.6: added the following item -->
<P><LI>The <CODE>LIB\</CODE> directory contains libraries that are required
for certain features of XWorkplace. Here you will find libraries for the
32 bit TCP/IP stack and the Odin Win32k driver.

<!-- V1.0.6: added the following item -->
<P><LI>The <CODE>MAKE\</CODE> directory holds a number of files that are included
by the makefiles and define some central macros and methods. No user-servicable parts
inside, though.

<!-- V1.0.6: added the following item -->
<P><LI>The <CODE>RELEASE\</CODE> directory tree contains many files that are part of
the XWorkplace distribution but unlikely to change between versions, especially REXX scripts,
icons, bitmaps, and sound files.

<P><LI>The <CODE>SRC\</CODE> directory tree contains the actual C/CPP source
files for XWorkplace.
<P>In that tree, <CODE>SRC\CLASSES\</CODE> has
the SOM code for the WPS classes which will be compiled into <CODE>XFLDR.DLL</CODE>.
It is this DLL which loads the NLS DLL
(<CODE>XFLDRxxx.DLL</CODE>, with xxx being a language code) at Desktop startup
or when the language is changed using the &quot;XWorkplace Internals&quot;
settings page. See <A HREF="src1_4maindll.html">this page</A> for more.
<P>The <CODE>SRC\HELPERS\</CODE> subdirectory contains a lot of C files with
helper functions which are independent of XWorkplace. That is, these can be used with
any OS/2 VIO and/or PM program. The functions are grouped into categories.
See <A HREF="src1_5helpers.html">this page</A> for more.
<B>Note:</B> This is now in a separate CVS archive on Netlabs, which is called
"xwphelpers". You need to check out that archive to be able to compile.
<P>The <CODE>SRC\HELPERS\</CODE> dir also contains files from Dennis Bareis' PMPRINTF package,
which is available in full from his homepage. Refer to the
<A HREF="src1_880debug.html">"Debugging XWorkplace"</A> section
for details.
<P>The other subdirectories in <CODE>SRC\</CODE> contain implementation code for
<CODE>XFLDR.DLL</CODE> (called by the SOM code in <CODE>SRC\CLASSES</CODE>)
or external programs which are part of XWorkplace, such as NetscapeDDE and Treesize.

<P><LI><CODE>TOOLS\</CODE> contains some tools used by the makefiles.
See <A HREF="src1_31make.html">Making XWorkplace</A>.
