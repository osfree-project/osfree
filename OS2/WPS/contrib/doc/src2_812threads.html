XWorkplace Threads

<BODY TEXT="#000000" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" LINK="#0000AA" VLINK="#777777">
XWorkplace is quite heavily multi-threaded and offloads most tasks which
are probable to take some time to several threads which are always running in
the background. Those threads create object windows and are thus normally
blocked, unless there's real work to do.
XWorkplace uses mutex semaphores all over the place to serialize access
to global data structures.

<P>With V0.9.0, all the thread code has been put into a new file, called
<CODE>src\filesys\xthreads.c</CODE>.

<P>All threads are created in <CODE>krnInitializeXWorkplace</CODE>
(<CODE>src\shared\kernel.c</CODE>),
which gets called from <CODE>M_XFldObject::wpclsInitData</CODE>, which is probably
the first SOM method called when the WPS is initializing at startup.
<P>All threads have some <CODE>fntXXXThread</CODE> function, which is
the main thread function passed to the <CODE>thr*</CODE> functions in
<CODE>/helpers/threads.c</CODE> when the thread is created.
These in turn create an object window using some <CODE>fnwpXXXObject</CODE>
function as their window procedure.
<P>For each thread, we then have some <CODE>krnPostXXXMsg</CODE> function
which posts a message to the corresponding object window. All messages are
defined and explained in <CODE>include\filesys\xthreads.h</CODE>.

<P>The following additional threads are available:

<UL><LI>The <B>Worker thread</B> is running with idle priority and does
mainly maintenance which is not time-critical.
<P>For example, the Worker thread maintains the global linked list of
currently awake Desktop objects. <CODE>XFldObject::wpObjectReady</CODE> post
<CODE>WOM_ADDAWAKEOBJECT</CODE> to the Worker thread, which then adds the object
to that list. (This list is needed by XShutdown to store all the awake
Desktop objects; see the <I>XWorkplace User Guide</I> for details).
<P>The Worker thread runs at &quot;Idle&quot; priority, unless more than 300
messages have piled up in its message queue. In this case, the
priority is temporarily raised to &quot;Regular&quot; and set back if the
message count goes below 10 again. This can happen when opening
folders with a very large number of objects.

<P><LI>The <B>&quot;Speedy&quot; thread</B> is running at a high
&quot;Regular&quot; priority for things which won't take long but should not
block the main WPS (Workplace) thread. This thread creates an object
window also.  For example, the <A HREF="src2_814sounds.html">new system sounds</A>
are played here, and the Desktop start logo is shown.

<P><LI>The <B>"File" thread</B> is new with V0.9.0 and runs with regular priority,
that is, concurrently with the WPS user interface. This now does file operations,
such as moving objects to and emptying the trash can and such.
This thread will probably get more jobs in the future.
