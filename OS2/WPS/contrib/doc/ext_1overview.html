This section describes how you can integrate your own code into XWorkplace.
Since XWorkplace is now a Netlabs project on the Netlabs CVS server, certain
rules must be followed so that the whole thing still works even though several
developers might be adding stuff.

<P>With XWorkplace V0.9.0, I have restructured the whole directory and
makefile system to allow for extending XWorkplace. In any case, the idea is
that all XWorkplace classes will reside in one single DLL, <CODE>XFLDR.DLL</CODE>,
but should be capable of being registered independently.

<P>Basically, there are two situations which you need to tell apart:

<OL><LI>You can <A HREF="ext_2addclass.html">add a new class to XWorkplace</A>. That is,
you wish to hook your code into the WPS, but XWorkplace doesn't have a class for
this yet. This situation applies both if you wish to replace a standard WPS class
(example: the spooler class, WPSpool) which XWorkplace doesn't replace yet, or if
you wish to create an all new class. (This only makes a difference at install time,
whether the install program will replace a class.)

<P><LI>You may choose to <A HREF="ext_3extend.html">extend an existing XWorkplace class</A>
(either an XWorkplace replacement for a default WPS class, e.g. XFolder, or a newly
introduced XWorkplace class, e.g. XFldWPS -- the "Workplace Shell" object).
This is much simpler, because you can build on existing code.
