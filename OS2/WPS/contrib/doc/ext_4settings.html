If you have added new code to XWorkplace, you might wonder how to integrate
your code into the <B>"XWorkplace Setup" object,</B> most notably, how to
add stuff to the "Features" container.

<P>This is pretty easy. The "Features" page uses a subclassed container
(the code for those checkboxes is in <CODE>helpers\comctl.c</CODE>, but
this you need not worry about). All you have to do is take a look at
<CODE>src\shared\xsetup.c</CODE>. The <CODE>setFeaturesInitPage</CODE>
function is responsible for initializing the container with the features,
while the <CODE>setFeaturesItemChanged</CODE> function reacts to selection
changes in the container.

<P>To add something, perform the following steps:

<OL><LI>Add a dialog item ID to <CODE>include\dlgids.h</CODE>, where all the
other items of this kind are (search for <CODE>ID_XCSI_GENERALFEATURES</CODE>
to find them).

<P><LI>Add a string for your setting to the NLS strings (e.g. for English, to
<CODE>001\xfldr001.rc</CODE>), using that ID.

<P><LI>Add your ID to the <CODE>FeatureItemsList</CODE> array in
<CODE>src\shared\xsetup.c</CODE>. Your item will then automatically get
inserted into the container by <CODE>setFeaturesInitPage</CODE>.

<P><LI>Still, in <CODE>setFeaturesInitPage</CODE>, you need to add a line
which checks the container checkbox according to the setting (those
<CODE>ctlSetRecordChecked(hwndFeaturesCnr ...</CODE> lines).

<P><LI>In <CODE>setFeaturesItemChanged</CODE>, add a case/switch which
reacts to user changes.
