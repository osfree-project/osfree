Testing Your NLS Files

XWorkplace's NLS depends entirely on a single entry in <CODE>OS2.INI</CODE>
("XFolder"::"LanguageCode"). This entry defaults to a "001" string and can
be changed either at installation time (if the install script does it) or
by using the "Language" setting in the "XWorkplace Setup" object.
<P><B>All NLS resources are loaded depending on this one setting.</B> That is,
if you change the language, XWorkplace expects not only your NLS DLL to be present
in <CODE>/BIN</CODE>, but also the TMF, HLP, and WPS class description
files in <CODE>/HELP</CODE>. So if you have not translated these yet, you might
want to create a copy of the English ones with your language code in the filename.

<P>To test a new version of your NLS files:
<UL><LI>Make sure you do not currently have your new <B>NLS DLL</B> selected on the
&quot;XWorkplace Internals&quot; settings page, because if you do, the DLL is locked
by XWorkplace
and cannot be replaced.

<P>Select &quot;US English&quot; instead, which will unlock the
previously used DLL, which can then be deleted from the XWorkplace directory.

<P>Then put your new DLL into the <CODE>BIN</CODE> subdirectory and open
the settings again; select your DLL and see if things work.

<P><LI>Additional caveat for <B>INF/HLP files:</B>
Before compiling the .IPF to the .HLP/.INF files, you should make
sure that the target file is not currently in use.

<P>With INF files, that's easy: simply close it if it's open.

<P>With HLP files, you have to keep in mind that the WPS keeps these
files locked even after you've closed a help panel window. However,
the WPS only ever keeps a single HLP file locked at a time, so in order to
unlock the XWorkplace HLP file, simply open a default WPS help panel,
e.g. by selecting &quot;Extended Help&quot; for the Desktop window.

<P>You can then copy the new XWorkplace .HLP file to the XWorkplace HELP
directory. (<CODE>nmake nls</CODE> will do this automatically.)
