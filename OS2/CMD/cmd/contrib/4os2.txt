                                                              INTRODUCTION
        ------------------------------------------------------------------



        INTRODUCTION


        Welcome, and thanks for purchasing 4DOS, 4OS2, or 4NT!

        We started developing these products when we realized that our
        computers could be a lot more powerful and a lot more helpful than
        they were.  Whether you are a computer novice or an experienced
        power user, we think that our products will help you get the most
        out of your IBM PC or compatible computer.

        We offer three different products which work with different
        operating systems:

             * You can use 4DOS with all versions of MS-DOS and PC-DOS
               from 3.1 through 7.1 and above ("MS-DOS 7" is the DOS
               portion of Microsoft Windows 95/98).  You can also use it
               with all versions of DR DOS / Novell DOS / OpenDOS from
               3.4 through 7.0 and above, and in DOS sessions started
               under Windows 3.0 or 3.1, Windows 95/98, OS/2 2.x, and
               OS/2 Warp 3 and 4.

             * You can use 4OS2 with OS/2 2.1 and above, and OS/2 Warp 3
               and 4.

             * You can use 4NT with Windows NT 3.5, 3.51, 4.0, and above.

        Once you have 4DOS, 4OS2, or 4NT installed, you can learn to use
        it at your own pace.  Each program has more than 90 commands and
        hundreds of enhanced features, but you don't have to learn them
        all, or learn them all at once.  Relax, enjoy the program's power,
        and browse through the manual occasionally.  Press the F1 key
        whenever you need help.  4DOS, 4OS2, or 4NT will soon become an
        essential part of your computer, and you'll wonder how you ever
        got along without it.

        We are constantly working to improve our products.  If you have
        suggestions for features or commands that you think we should
        include in the next version, or any other way we could improve our
        product, please let us know.  Many of the improvements in this
        version were suggested by our users, and while we can't promise to
        include every suggested feature, we really do appreciate and
        consider your comments.

        4DOS, 4OS2, and 4NT are related programs that work in text or
        command-line mode.  If you use Windows 3.x, Windows 95/98,
        Windows NT, or OS/2, we also offer Take Command, a graphical
        program that includes the power of 4DOS, 4OS2, and 4NT plus
        several additional features, and which runs in a desktop window.

                                                              INTRODUCTION
        ------------------------------------------------------------------


             * Take Command/16 runs under Windows 3.x, Windows for
               Workgroups, and Windows sessions in OS/2.

             * Take Command/32 runs under Windows 95/98 and Windows NT.

             * Take Command for OS/2 runs on the OS/2 Presentation
               Manager desktop.

        You can use these products to maintain a common working
        environment and run the same commands, batch files, and aliases
        under DOS, OS/2, Windows, Windows 95/98, and Windows NT.
        Additional products for use on the same system are available at
        a discounted price for 4DOS, 4OS2, and 4NT users.  Our JP CD
        Suite includes all six products.  Licenses for multiple systems
        are also available.  Contact your software reseller or JP
        Software for more information.


        How to Use This Manual

             This manual is only one part of the documentation that you
             will need for 4DOS, 4OS2, or 4NT.  It introduces the product
             and will help you install it correctly on your computer.  It
             also gives you specific information about using the program
             in your particular environment (for example, using 4DOS under
             DOS, Windows, or OS/2).

             The second part of our documentation is the Reference Manual
             and the online help.  They contain complete information about
             the commands and features of 4DOS, 4OS2, and 4NT.

             You should start with this introductory manual whether you
             are new to our programs or you are upgrading from a previous
             version.  Once you have successfully installed 4DOS, 4OS2, or
             4NT you can move on to the Reference Manual or the help for
             detailed information on commands, features, and
             configuration.

             The first three chapters of this manual introduce the
             products and help you install the program and its built-in
             help system.  Chapters 4 - 7 contain additional details about
             each product and operating environment.  We encourage you to
             review the material in the later chapters to see what applies
             to you (particularly if you are using 4DOS under Windows
             95/98 or OS/2, or with Novell Netware).  However, in many
             cases you will not need the information in Chapters 4 - 7
             unless you are working at a more technical level, or run
             into some unexpected difficulty.

                                                              INTRODUCTION
        ------------------------------------------------------------------


             Most of the first part of this manual describes commands and
             features which are available in all three products.  When we
             need to discuss the features or behavior of a single product,
             we mention it specifically in the text.  When an entire
             paragraph or section applies to a specific product, we use
             marginal text to identify that product:

     4DOS    marks sections that apply only to 4DOS.

     4OS2    marks sections that apply only to 4OS2.

     4NT     marks sections that apply only to 4NT.

             Each of our products also includes complete online help for
             all commands.  The 4DOS and 4OS2 help systems can be
             configured to link to help on standard DOS and OS/2 commands
             as well, if the corresponding help files and programs are
             available on your system.  Our online help provides much of
             the same information that is available in this manual and the
             Reference Manual, but in an electronic form which you can
             access quickly.  The online help also includes details about
             changes in the latest version of our products, compatibility
             with other products, and additional technical information.
             See page 25 for more information about the online help.

             Finally, be sure to check README.TXT for last-minute notes on
             the current release, or if you are installing a downloaded
             update to 4DOS, 4OS2, or 4NT.

             Before You Contact Us

             Before contacting us for support, please check this manual,
             the Reference Manual, the online help, and other
             documentation for answers to your question.  If you can't
             find what you need, try the Index.  If you're having trouble
             getting 4DOS, 4OS2, or 4NT to run properly, see the
             Troubleshooting, Service, and Support topic in the online
             help for any relevant information (in 4DOS, check the
             Compatibility section as well), and look through the
             README.TXT file for any last-minute information for your
             product.

        ------------------------------------------------------------------


             If you do need to contact us for support, it helps if you can
             give us some basic information.  The first four items listed
             below are essential for us to be able to understand and
             assist you with your problem:

                  * What environment are you working in?  This includes
                    the operating system version are you using, the
                    version of the JP Software product involved, and
                    related information such as network connections and
                    the name and version number of any other software
                    which appears to be involved in the problem.  Use the
                    VER /R command to determine the command interpreter
                    and operating system version.

                  * What exactly did you do?  A concise description of
                    what steps you must take to make the problem appear
                    is much more useful than a long analysis of what
                    might be happening.

                  * What did you expect to happen?  Tell us the result
                    you expected from the command or operation in
                    question, so that we understand what you are trying
                    to do.

                  * What actually happened?  At what point did the
                    failure occur?  If you saw an error message or other
                    important or unusual information on the screen, what
                    exactly did it say?

                  * Briefly, what techniques did you use to try to
                    resolve the problem?  What results did you get?

                  * If the problem seems related to startup and
                    configuration issues, what are the contents of any
                    startup files you use (such as CONFIG.SYS,
                    AUTOEXEC.BAT, 4START, 4EXIT, and the .INI file), any
                    batch files they call, and any alias or environment
                    variable files they load?

                  * Can you repeat the problem or does it occur randomly?
                    If it's random, does it seem related to the programs
                    you're using when the problem occurs?

             If you have a problem with a batch file or complex alias,
             please contact us electronically if possible.  Include an
             exact copy of the batch file or alias in question, preferably
             as part of the text of your message (not as an attachment).

        ------------------------------------------------------------------


             If you do not have electronic access, contact us by fax if
             possible.  Problems of this type are usually very difficult
             to diagnose over the telephone because we cannot see the
             material you are working with.  If your batch file is longer
             than about 20 lines, please try to reproduce the problem in a
             smaller test file; otherwise it will probably be impossible
             for us to understand and recreate the difficulty you found.

             If you need more in-depth assistance with the development of
             complex batch files or other procedures, please contact us
             for information on consulting services.


             Electronic Support

             Usually the best way to contact us for support is via email
             (you can also contact us in our CompuServe support
             conference).  Our CompuServe and Internet addresses are
             listed on page 4.
             
             Whenever possible, we also read messages posted on the
             Usenet comp.os.msdos.4dos newsgroup, (this newsgroup is
             named for 4DOS, but carries messages related to all JP
             Software products).  This newsgroup offers valuable
             information and discussions with other users, but is not
             managed by JP Software, and is not an official support
             channels.  To be certain of a direct answer from our
             support staff use email, or contact us by telephone, fax,
             or mail.

             Additional support resources are available from our web site
             at htp://www.jpsoft.com/, including error message listings,
             documentation files, product histories, technical tips and
             discussions, other technical information, and links to other
             companies' sites.  We update this information regularly, and
             we encourage you to check the Technical Support area of the
             web site to see if the information there will address any
             questions you have.


             Telephone Support

             Telephone technical support within the US and Canada is
             handled on a callback basis.  To contact our support staff,
             call our US / Canada Support Line at any time and leave a
             short voice mail message describing your technical problem.
             The telephone number is 781-646-0798.  This line can not be
             used for sales and customer service issues such as pricing,
             ordering, upgrades, or shipping problems.  We check messages

             regularly throughout the day, and will return your call as
             quickly as possible.

             We generally return all technical support calls within 24
             hours (weekends and holidays excluded), and most are returned
             much more quickly, usually on the same business day.  If your
             problem is urgent and requires a faster response, please let
             us know and we will try to accommodate you.  If you contact
             us by telephone and don't receive a reply within 24 hours,
             please try again.  We may have tried to return your call and
             been unable to reach you.

             If you are calling from outside the US and Canada, are not
             sure if your question requires technical support, need other
             assistance in addition to your technical questions, or find
             yourself playing "telephone tag" with our support staff,
             please call our main number, 781-646-3975.  Our office staff
             will assist you with all of your concerns, and have a
             technical support representative call you back if necessary.


        Registration and Upgrade Information

             If you purchased 4DOS, 4OS2, or 4NT from a software dealer,
             your copy came with a registration card.  Please fill out
             this card and return it promptly to JP Software.  It ensures
             that we have a record of your registration so that we can
             give you ongoing technical support and notices of upgrades.
             If you purchased 4DOS, 4OS2, or 4NT directly from JP
             Software, or ordered an electronic copy via our web site, you
             are already registered and no registration card is necessary.

             Once you are a registered user, with each notice of a major
             upgrade you will receive The Prompt Solution, JP Software's
             customer newsletter.  The Prompt Solution also includes tips
             for using 4DOS, 4OS2, and 4NT, and information about other
             products from JP Software.  Registration also entitles you to
             full technical support via electronic mail, fax, mail, or
             telephone.

             4DOS, 4OS2, and 4NT are upgraded regularly through
             maintenance releases, designed to fix minor problems or
             improve compatibility, and major upgrades which contain
             enhancements and additional features.  Maintenance releases
             are identified by a change in the hundredths digit of the
             version number, for example from 6.0 to 6.01 or 6.02, or in a
             letter suffix (e.g. 6.01B).  Major upgrades are identified by
             a change in the tenths digit or "ones" digit, for example
             from 6.0 to 6.1 or 7.0.

        ------------------------------------------------------------------


             Major upgrades can be purchased from JP Software or your
             dealer.  You can download maintenance releases from our web
             site (http://www.jpsoft.com/), or from the CompuServe or BBS
             locations listed under Contacting JP Software on page 3.  You
             can also order them on disk at a nominal cost.

             As a registered user, you will automatically be notified when
             a major upgrade is released.  We don't send out notices when
             maintenance releases become available, because you don't
             usually need them unless you're having a problem.  If you
             call with a problem that's been addressed in a maintenance
             release, we'll mail you a copy on disk or assist you in
             downloading it.

             If you want to know when a product update is available, visit
             our web site at http://www.jpsoft.com/.  Notices are posted
             there whenever one or more of our products is updated, and
             email or other automated methods for upgrade notification may
             become available on the web site in the future.

                               Chapter 1 / Introducing 4DOS, 4OS2, and 4NT
        ------------------------------------------------------------------



        Chapter 1 / Introducing 4DOS, 4OS2, and 4NT


        4DOS, 4OS2, and 4NT are command interpreters or "Shells."  That
        means that they display a C:\> or [C:\] prompt, wait for you to
        type something, and then react to your commands.  Our programs
        replace the default command interpreters that are supplied with
        your operating system.  4DOS replaces COMMAND.COM for DOS, Windows
        95/98, and for DOS sessions under OS/2.  4OS2 and 4NT replace
        CMD.EXE.

        We've designed our products so that you don't have to change your
        computing habits or unlearn anything to use them.  If you know how
        to display a directory, copy a file, or start an application
        program, you already know how to use our command interpreters --
        and if you're not used to using the command line, you'll
        appreciate our programs' comprehensive online help and the way
        they make the command prompt straightforward and easy to use.

        4DOS, 4OS2, and 4NT understand all of the commands you may already
        know and add to them.  Their purpose is to make the command line
        friendlier, easier to use, and much more powerful and versatile
        without requiring you to use or learn a new program, a new set of
        commands, or a new style of work.

        In this section, we introduce a few of the features we have built
        into our products.  We don't have room to list them all or to
        explain all of the options available in each; that's what the
        Reference Manual and online help are for.  This section will just
        give you a taste of what you can expect from your computer once
        you have your new command interpreter installed.

        As you read through this section, remember that you don't have to
        use any of these features except the ones that appeal to you.
        Learn just the parts that will make your computer easier for you
        to use, and add more features to your repertoire as you find that
        you need them.


        Built-In Commands

             4DOS, 4OS2, and 4NT support every command you already know,
             add to the features of each command, and also add dozens of
             new commands.

             For example, the traditional DIR command, which displays a
             list of files, has about 8 options.  The DIR command in our
             products has most of the same options plus almost 20 more.
             With the enhanced DIR command, you can:

        ------------------------------------------------------------------


                  * Display a list of files in 1, 2, 4, or 5 columns with
                    the commands:

                         c:\> dir
                         c:\> dir /2
                         c:\> dir /4
                         c:\> dir /w

                  * Use colors to indicate different kinds of files,
                    display file descriptions (text to remind you of the
                    contents of a file) along with file names, and sort
                    files according to several different criteria.

                  * Display hidden and system files, along with normal
                    files.  For example, this command displays all of the
                    files in the current directory, whether they are
                    "hidden" or not:

                         c:\> dir /a

                  * Display files of one type or of several types
                    together.  For example, this command lists all .TXT,
                    .DOC, and .ASC files in the current directory:

                         c:\> dir *.txt;*.doc;*.asc

                  * Display files from a single directory, from one part
                    of the directory tree, from a single drive, or from
                    several drives.

                  * Use wildcards to display all file names that start
                    with the letter "A", end with the letter "A", or have
                    an "A" anywhere in the name:

                         c:\> dir a*
                         c:\> dir *a
                         c:\> dir *a*

                  * If you use Windows 95/98 or Windows NT, you can view
                    either "long" file names, "short" file names, or
                    both.

             That's just an example of some of the enhancements we have
             added to one command.  4DOS, 4OS2, and 4NT have added
             enhancements to virtually every command you've used before
             and include dozens of new commands as well.  You don't have
             to learn to use them all, but you will find many commands and
             enhancements that will make your computer more powerful and
             easier to use.  For example:

                  * COLOR lets you set the default colors to use on your
                    display:

                         c:\> color bright white on blue

                    Additional features let you customize the colors you
                    want to use for parts of the display, for input and
                    output, and for specific kinds of files.

                  * LIST displays the contents of files in text or
                    hexadecimal mode, lets you search a file, and can
                    print either an entire file or a single page from a
                    file:

                         c:\> list readme.txt

                  * FFIND searches for files based on their names and
                    their contents.  For example, to find all files on
                    drive C: with the string "now" somewhere within their
                    names:

                         c:\> ffind /s *now*

                    To find all .TXT files in the current directory which
                    contain the string "then" somewhere in the file:

                         c:\> ffind /t"then" *.txt

                  * SELECT lets you pick the files you want to work with
                    from a full-screen, "point and shoot" display.  This
                    command, for example, lets you select files from the
                    current directory to copy to the floppy in drive A:

                         c:\> select copy (*.*) a:

                  * EXCEPT lets you work with all of the files in a
                    directory except those that you want to exclude.  It
                    is something like wildcards in reverse.  (A related
                    feature, "exclude" ranges, also works like reverse
                    wildcards, and can be used to exclude files from any
                    internal command.)  This command copies all files
                    from the current directory to drive A: except backup
                    (.BAK and .BK!) files:

                         c:\> except (*.bak;*.bk!) copy *.* a:

        ------------------------------------------------------------------


        The Command Line

             4DOS, 4OS2, and 4NT are much more than just a collection of
             commands.  They include a number of features which make the
             command line easier to use:

                  * Interactive help appears whenever you ask for it and
                    also any time you use a command incorrectly.  Type:

                         c:\> help

                    when you need help.  You can also press F1 to view
                    the help Table of Contents.  If you have typed part
                    of a command, F1 displays help on the first word on
                    the command line.

                  * The command line works like a single-line word
                    processor.  You can edit any part of the line at any
                    time before you press Enter to execute it or Esc to
                    erase it.  You can move the cursor left and right by
                    a single character, a single word, or jump to the
                    beginning or end of the line.  You can delete,
                    insert, or type over characters anywhere on the
                    command line.

                  * 4DOS, 4OS2, and 4NT keep track of each command you
                    execute.  You can display past commands, execute them
                    again, or make changes before you execute them.  The
                    past commands can appear on the command line (if you
                    press -), or in a pop-up window (if you press PgUp).

                  * If you don't want to type a complete file name as
                    part of a command, you don't have to.  Just type part
                    of the name and then press the Tab key:  a matching
                    file or directory name will appear on the command
                    line.  Press the Tab key again to see the next
                    matching file.  To choose from all matching files in
                    a pop-up window, press F7 or Ctrl-Tab.

                    The ability to complete filenames easily can be
                    invaluable on a drive with long filenames - all you
                    have to do is type part of a lengthy file or
                    directory name and press Tab.  The command
                    interpreter fills in the rest.

                  * 4DOS, 4OS2, and 4NT keep track of each directory you
                    have visited.  There are many ways to return to
                    previous directories; perhaps the easiest is to press
                    Ctrl-PgUp to view past directories in a pop-up
                    window.  Select the directory you want, press Enter,

                    and you will immediately change to that directory,
                    even if it is on a different drive.

                  * Our programs also use an extended directory search
                    "database" that will help you move, almost instantly,
                    to any directory on any hard drive on your system
                    when you type just part of the directory name.

                  * Our command interpreters include features that let
                    you select files by size, date, and time; to use
                    multiple sets of wildcards at once; and to associate
                    applications with their data files.  For example,
                    this command makes it simple to copy all files in the
                    current directory that have been updated in the last
                    week to a backup disk:

                         c:\> copy /[d-7] *.* a:\

                    Or you can delete all .BAK files that are greater
                    than 1 MB in size:

                         c:\> del /[s1M] *.bak

                    With a simple change you can make the command delete
                    the same files, but from the entire drive rather than
                    just the current directory (use a command like this
                    with caution!):

                         c:\> del /s /[s1M] *.bak

                  * 4DOS, 4OS2, and 4NT let you associate file extensions
                    with particular applications.  For example, it's easy
                    to start your word processor and load a letter
                    anytime you type the name of an .LTR file:

                         c:\> set .LTR=c:\wp\wordproc.exe

                    After you have defined the association, you can start
                    your word processor and have it load your letter to
                    Mom, MOM.LTR, with this command (assuming the file is
                    in the current directory):

                         c:\letters> mom

                  * You can also run multiple commands at one time.  If
                    you know the next 3 commands you need to run, you can
                    type them all at once and then sit back while they
                    are executed one at a time.  For example, to copy all
                    of your .TXT files to drive A: and then display the
                    directory of drive A:

        Configuration

             We don't know how you use your computer, or how you would
             like it to work, so we have made our programs as flexible as
             possible.  With the included configuration utility you can
             configure almost every part of 4DOS, 4OS2, and 4NT to suit
             your needs or your whims.  To start the configuration
             utility, type

                  c:\> option

             For example, you can decide what colors to use for what
             purposes, how file names are displayed in command output, and
             command line editing details ranging from the size and
             location of pop-up windows to the shape of the cursor.

     4DOS    If conventional memory is tight on your DOS computer, you can
             configure 4DOS to squeeze out every last possible byte, using
             extended (XMS) memory, expanded (EMS) memory, upper memory
             blocks (UMBs), or conventional memory.  In many
             installations, 4DOS uses just 256 bytes of conventional
             memory, leaving as much room free as possible for memory-
             hungry DOS application programs, memory-resident utilities,
             and games.


        Aliases and Batch Files

             We've left two of the most popular and powerful features,
             aliases and batch files, for last.


             Aliases

             Aliases are short sequences of commands which are stored in
             memory for very fast execution.  Aliases can assign complex
             tasks to simple names or single keystrokes, define new
             commands, and set defaults for internal commands and for
             almost any application on your computer.  They are the
             primary method we offer for customizing your command line to
             suit your needs.

             Here are a few examples of how you could define simple
             aliases to make the command line easier to use.  The first
             two provide shorthand names for the DIR command -- D displays

        ------------------------------------------------------------------

        ------------------------------------------------------------------


             a directory, and D2 displays a 2-column directory, sorted
             vertically, with a pause at the end of each page:

                  c:\> alias d dir
                  c:\> alias d2 dir /2pv

             Once these definitions have been entered, all you have to do
             is type D or D2 at the prompt to execute the corresponding
             alias.

             You can also define aliases as shorthand ways to execute
             applications, usually without having to add the application's
             directory to your PATH.  For example, this alias allows you
             to just type EDIT to run your editor, even if its directory
             is not on the PATH:

                  c:\> alias edit e:\edfiles\editor.exe

             You can put a whole group of commands into an alias so that
             you can invoke them without typing each one.  This alias
             changes directories, runs the FINPROC program, and changes
             back to the original directory (the back-quotes [`] are used
             to enclose an alias when it contains more than one command).
             This alias should be entered on a single line:

     4DOS         c:\> alias monthly `pushd c:\monthly ^ finproc ^ popd`

     4OS2, 4NT    [c:\] alias monthly `pushd c:\monthly & finproc & popd`

             This short description explains only the basics of what
             aliases can do.  Like most 4DOS, 4OS2, and 4NT features,
             aliases can be as simple or as complex as you like.  You can
             save your aliases in a file and reload them each time the
             command interpreter starts (otherwise, you'd have to redefine
             them each time); assign aliases to keystrokes so they can be
             invoked quickly; write aliases which use other aliases; and
             use aliases within batch files.  For complete information on
             aliases see Chapter 4 of the Reference Manual, the ALIAS
             command in Chapter 6 of the Reference Manual, or the online
             help.


             Batch Files

             A batch file or batch program is a text file that contains a
             list of commands to execute.  4DOS, 4OS2, and 4NT read and
             interpret each line as if it had been typed at the keyboard.
             If you're an experienced batch file programmer, or if you
             want an easy introduction to batch file programming, you

             won't find anything more powerful than our built-in batch
             language.

             The batch language includes simple commands to display menus,
             boxes, lines, and colored text to dress up your batch file
             displays; a full range of user input commands; over 70 built-
             in variables that let your batch files test system
             configuration, device status, and free memory and disk space;
             and almost 100 built-in functions that let your batch files
             read from files, find the date, perform calculations, and
             manipulate strings.

             Our batch files run 2 to 10 times faster than traditional
             ones.  They can include subroutines, loops, IF/THEN/ELSE
             logic, and even exception handling.  And you can run them in
             single-step mode to debug them easily, learn exactly what
             each line does, or view changes to environment variables and
             other information as the batch file executes.

             Here are a couple of examples of simple batch files.  The
             first example displays several pieces of information about
             your system status, using built-in variables provided with
             4DOS, 4OS2, and 4NT:

                  cls
                  echo System status as of %_date at %_time:
                  echo CPU:  %_cpu
                  echo Coprocessor:  %_ndp
                  echo Screen size:  %_rows x %_columns
                  echo Boot drive:  %_boot
                  echo DOS version:  %_dosver
                  echo Command processor version:  %_4ver
                  echo Country code:  %_country

             The next example clears the screen, displays a short menu,
             accepts some input from the user, and displays the result (a
             more useful version of this file would actually perform the
             requested action; for now we're just trying to give you the
             overall flavor of our batch enhancements).  The TEXT command
             displays a block of text on the screen, the SCREEN command
             positions the cursor, and the INKEY command accepts a single
             keystroke from the user:

                  cls
                  screen 5 0

        ------------------------------------------------------------------



        Chapter 2 / Installation


        All copies of 4DOS, 4OS2, and 4NT come with automated software
        that makes installation simple and straightforward.  The
        instructions for running this software vary depending on whether
        your copy came on a diskette or CD, or was downloaded from an on-
        line source.

        The installation software will set up the command interpreter
        automatically if you wish, and we recommend that you use this
        method.  However, if you prefer to set up the program yourself you
        can allow the installation software to handle only certain
        required tasks (such as extracting files from a distribution
        disk), and perform the remaining steps manually.  Manual
        installation is covered in detail for each product in Chapters
        5 - 7.


        Preparing for Installation

             You can install and use each of our products under most
             recent operating system versions.  If you are using an older
             version of any operating system, or you want to use a product
             under a different operating system than the one for which it
             is sold, consult Chapter 5, 6, or 7 (depending on the
             product) for details on compatibility before proceeding with
             installation.

             We strongly recommend that you install your new version of
             4DOS, 4OS2, or 4NT in a new directory or folder, rather than
             using the same directory as a previous version, or a
             directory used by other software.

     4DOS When installing 4DOS under Windows 95/98, we also strongly
             recommend that you use a short name for the 4DOS directory
             (i.e. a name where each element of the path uses more than
             eight characters for the name and three characters for the
             extension, with no white space or other special
             characters).  If you install 4DOS in a directory with a
             long name, you will have to determine the equivalent short
             name and use it throughout the installation process.

             When you install your new command interpreter, some system
             files (e.g. CONFIG.SYS, AUTOEXEC.BAT, or your system
             registry) may need to be modified.  You can allow the
             installation software to make these changes automatically, or
             you can make them yourself at a later time (see Manual
             Installation in Chapters 5 - 7 for details).  The Express

             Installation option (see below) updates system files
             automatically; the Custom Installation option prompts you for
             confirmation before system files are updated.

             You will normally use a command or DOS prompt to begin the
             installation process.  The command prompt can be run using
             the default command interpreter (COMMAND.COM or CMD.EXE) or a
             previous version of the product you are installing.  If you
             are unsure of how to start a command prompt for installation,
             use these instructions:

     4DOS         If you are running plain DOS, just use your current DOS
                  prompt.  If you are running Windows or Windows 95/98,
                  start an "MS-DOS prompt" session, or a 4DOS session if
                  you have a previous version.  If you are running OS/2,
                  start a "DOS Window" or "DOS Full Screen" session from
                  the Command Prompts folder.

     4OS2         Start an "OS/2 Window" or "OS/2 Full Screen" session
                  from the Command Prompts folder.

     4NT          Start an "MS-DOS Prompt" session, or a 4NT session if
                  you have a previous version.

             You can also use your operating system's "start" mechanism,
             such as the Windows 95/98 Start button, to start the
             installation program directly.  However, the instructions
             below assume you are working from a command prompt.


             Installing an Upgrade

             Use the standard installation instructions below to install
             an upgrade.  The installation procedure is essentially the
             same as when you are installing a new copy of the program.

             If you are upgrading from a previous version, you may have a
             4DOS.INI, 4OS2.INI, 4NT.INI, and / or 4START or 4EXIT files
             in the previous version's directory.  To use these files with
             the new version, you must copy them to the new directory, and
             update the .INI file in some cases.  You can allow the
             installation software to perform these steps automatically,
             or you can perform them yourself at a later time (see
             Chapters 5 - 7 for details).


        Starting the Installation Software

             Our products are distributed using four standard methods:
             via electronic purchase, on a single-product diskette from JP

             Software, on the JP CD Suite, or in a downloaded .ZIP file.
             Instructions for each format are below; be sure to follow the
             instructions which correspond to the way you obtained the
             program.

             If your copy of the program came from a collection of trial
             software on CD or diskette, and is stored in a .ZIP or other
             similar file, use the instructions which refer to a
             downloaded copy, even if you did not actually download the
             program.


             Installation of an Electronically Purchased Copy

             If your copy of 4DOS, 4OS2, or 4NT was purchased and
             delivered electronically (e.g., from the on-line ordering
             section of our web site), you can simply extract the
             downloaded files to a temporary directory, then start the
             INSTALL.EXE program.  It will offer the same Express and
             Custom installation options described in the next section,
             and you can follow the directions for those options below.


             Installation from a JP Software Diskette or CD-ROM

             To begin the installation process, make sure you have a
             command or DOS prompt available (if you need instructions see
             Preparing for Installation above).  Then start the
             installation program:

                  * If you have a JP Software diskette, put the disk into
                    drive A, then type this command at the prompt:

                         a:install

                    You can use drive B if you prefer, in which case you
                    should substitute "b:" for "a:" in the command above.

                  * If you have the JP CD Suite, put the CD into your
                    CD-ROM drive, then type one of these commands at the
                    prompt:

                         d:\4dos\install
                         d:\4os2\install
                         d:\4nt\install

                    where "d:" is the drive letter used for your CD-ROM.

             The installation software will offer two options:

                                                  Chapter 2 / Installation
        ------------------------------------------------------------------


                  * Express Installation will install the program
                    automatically on your system and, as necessary, make
                    appropriate modifications to CONFIG.SYS,
                    AUTOEXEC.BAT, your current command processor startup
                    files, and your system registry, without further
                    prompting (except for required directory
                    information).  If you are installing the product
                    under Windows 95/98, Windows NT, or OS/2, a new object
                    will be created on the desktop to run the program.

                  * Custom Installation will extract or copy the 4DOS,
                    4OS2, or 4NT files to your hard disk, then prompt you
                    for confirmation before each installation step
                    (including modifications to system files and the
                    desktop).

             To install the program manually, use the Custom Installation
             option to extract or copy the necessary files, skip the steps
             you do not want performed automatically, and refer to the
             Manual Installation instructions in Chapters 5 - 7.

             The diskette and electronic purchase installation programs
             also offer an Extract Individual Files option.  This is used
             for restoring damaged files, and is not needed during a
             normal installation.  It is not offered on the JP CD Suite,
             because no "extraction" process is necessary - individual
             files can be copied with a simple COPY command.


             "Branding"

             If you received your copy of 4DOS, 4OS2, or 4NT on a JP
             Software diskette or CD-ROM, you will have a "brand card" or
             label with a serial number and validation code (in some cases
             you will have a separate card or label for each product).  If
             your diskette or CD was purchased directly from JP Software
             the brand card will also include your registered name
             (company or individual).

             If your copy was purchased electronically the serial number
             and validation code are included in the materials you
             received as part of the purchase transaction.

             The serial number and validation code constitute your
             license, and are provided only with purchased copies, not
             with trial copies.

             A program which comes with each product checks your
             registered name, serial number, and validation code, and
             saves them for use by 4DOS, 4OS2, or 4NT.  This process,

             which we call "branding," personalizes your copy and removes
             the "unregistered copy" or other similar message which is
             displayed if you skip this step.  Depending on the
             distribution mechanism used, some copies may not work at all
             until they are branded.  The actual brand program name
             depends on the product (e.g. BR4DOS.EXE for 4DOS, etc.).

             The branding program is run automatically during the
             installation process.  As you follow the instructions to
             enter your name, serial number, and validation code, be sure
             that all information is entered exactly as shown on the brand
             card, label, or electronic branding information you received.
             You cannot change spelling, capitalization, or punctuation.
             If you need to run the branding program manually, see the
             instructions in Chapters 5 - 7.

             You may also need to run the branding program when you
             download a maintenance upgrade to any product.  Branding a
             downloaded copy converts it from a timed trial copy to one
             fully registered to you.  For this reason you should save
             your brand card, label, or electronically delivered branding
             information,  in case it is needed when you download or
             purchase an upgrade.  If you lose the branding information
             there is a charge to create a replacement card or label.


             Installation of a Downloaded Trial Copy

             To begin the installation process, make sure you have a
             command or DOS prompt available (if you need instructions,
             see Preparing for Installation above).  Then:

                  * Make sure you have extracted the files into a new
                    directory using PKUNZIP or a similar utility.

                  * At the prompt, change to the directory with your new
                    copy of 4DOS, 4OS2, or 4NT.  This step is essential.

                  * Enter the name of the program you are installing at
                    the prompt:

                         C:\4DOS600> 4dos

                         [C:\4OS2300] 4os2

                         [C:\4NT300] 4nt

             4DOS, 4OS2, or 4NT will then run its installation procedure
             and set itself up for your system automatically.  You can

        ------------------------------------------------------------------


             allow the installation software to modify system files
             automatically, or modify them yourself at a later time.

             If you have an up-to-date copy of 4DOS, 4OS2, or 4NT, and
             have downloaded a maintenance upgrade, you may need to brand
             the new version with your registered name and serial number
             (see the previous section for details on branding).  The
             automated installation procedure for the downloaded copy will
             start the branding program for you if possible.  To brand a
             downloaded copy manually, see the instructions in Chapters
             5 - 7.

             If you try to brand a downloaded copy of a new major release,
             and you have not purchased a license for that release, the
             branding  program will display a message indicating that you
             need to contact JP Software or your dealer for an upgrade.
             Once you have ordered an upgrade you can continue to use the
             downloaded trial version until your upgrade arrives.

             The automatic installation procedure for downloaded copies
             only runs the first time you start a new copy of 4DOS, 4OS2,
             or 4NT.  If you need to re-install a downloaded copy, use the
             manual installation instructions in Chapters 5 - 7.


        Uninstalling the Program

             We don't expect you to have trouble using our programs, but
             we know some people feel more comfortable knowing how to
             uninstall a product as well as install it.  Or, you may need
             to remove the program from one system to move it to another
             system.

             To remove a purchased copy of 4DOS, 4OS2, or 4NT just insert
             the distribution diskette or CD, start the INSTALL program as
             described on page 19, and select the Uninstall option.
             Uninstall will offer you options which "undo" the
             corresponding steps in the installation procedure.  Complete
             Uninstall will take all of the other steps automatically, and
             remove the program entirely from your system.

             The Uninstall option will attempt to reverse the changes made
             during installation, including modifications to your system
             files.  However, if you have removed files, changed your
             directory structure significantly, moved COMMAND.COM or
             CMD.EXE, or otherwise modified your system configuration,
             then the program may not be able to complete all of the steps
             automatically and you will need to perform some of them
             manually.

        Chapter 3 / The Help System


        All of our products include complete online help.  This chapter
        provides a basic description of how to use the help system, and
        lists important help topics you may want to refer to.

        Additional details are covered in the help system itself.  If you
        need information on how to view the help text even when the
        corresponding product is not running, or additional information on
        configuring the help system for a specific product, see the
        details for your product in Chapters 5 - 7.


        Using the Help System

             If 4DOS, 4OS2, or 4NT is running, you can start the help
             system by typing HELP (or HELP plus a command name) at the
             prompt, or by pressing the F1 key at any time at the command
             line.  The information in each help system is fully cross-
             referenced, so you can move easily among related commands.

             If you type part or all of a command on the command line and
             then press F1, the help system will provide "context-
             sensitive" help by using the first word on the line as a help
             topic.  If the first word is not a valid help topic you will
             see the Table of Contents (in 4DOS), or an error message (in
             4OS2 or 4NT).  For example, if you press F1 after entering
             each of the command lines shown below you will get the
             display indicated:

                  c:\>                Table of Contents
                  c:\> copy *.* a:    Help on COPY
                  c:\> c:\util\map    Table of Contents (4DOS);
                                      error (4OS2 or 4NT)

             If you type the name of any internal command at the prompt,
             followed by a slash and a question mark [/?] like this

                  c:\> copy /?

             then you will see help for the command in a quick-reference
             style.

             Once you've started the help system, you can use a standard
             set of keystrokes or mouse actions to navigate through the
             help text.

        Chapter 4 / Configuration (All Products)


        Once you have 4DOS. 4OS2, or 4NT installed on your computer, the
        program is ready to run.  However, you can configure each program
        in various ways to suit your needs and preferences.  Most of the
        configuration or behavior of each program is controlled by aliases
        you create (explained in Chapter 4 of the Reference Manual, and in
        the online help) and by the .INI file (explained briefly below,
        and in detail in Chapter 5 of the Reference Manual, and in the
        online help).

        A few configuration options can also be set on the startup command
        line, which is explained here.  In order to understand the startup
        command line you will also need to understand primary and
        secondary shells, so that topic is covered first.

        If you do not need to alter the startup behavior of 4DOS, 4OS2, or
        4NT, you can skip the remainder of this chapter.  If you are using
        our products under OS/2 or any flavor of Windows, we recommend
        that you read through this chapter, since each time you create a
        desktop object to run the command interpreter you will have to
        create a startup command line for that object.


        Primary and Secondary Shells

             4DOS, 4OS2, and 4NT can be run as either primary or secondary
             shells.

             Under DOS, Windows 3.x, and Windows 95/98, a primary shell is
             started from the CONFIG.SYS file with a SHELL= command.
             Secondary shells are started when a program "shells" to the
             DOS prompt or runs a "transient" (temporary) shell to execute
             a specific command, or when you explicitly start a new shell
             from a desktop object under Windows 3.x or Windows 95/98.

             Under OS/2 and Windows NT, a primary shell is started each
             time you start a new command-line session or window from the
             desktop.  A secondary shell is started when a program
             "shells" to the command prompt, or runs a "transient"
             (temporary) shell to execute a specific command.

             Whenever you start a primary or secondary shell, you can
             control the way that 4DOS, 4OS2, or 4NT starts by adjusting
             the startup command line.

        Command Line Options

             A few of the command-line switches or options that 4DOS,
             4OS2, and 4NT recognize are required in certain
             circumstances; most others are needed only if you want finer
             control over the way the program starts.

             The line that starts 4DOS, 4OS2, or 4NT will typically
             include the program name with drive and path, optionally
             repeat the name of the directory where the program is stored,
             and finally include any switches for the program, for
             example:

                  e:\4dos600\4dos.com e:\4dos600 /p

             This command line may appear on its own (for example, in a
             Windows or OS/2 desktop object), or in an operating system
             directive (e.g. the SHELL command in the DOS, OS/2, or
             Windows 95/98 CONFIG.SYS file).  Specific details on where
             you should enter the command line for each product are
             included in Chapters 5 - 7.

             Although the startup command line is usually very simple, you
             can add a number of options if you need to customize the way
             the command interpreter starts.  The complete syntax for the
             startup command line is:

                  d:\path\program [d:\path] [@d:\path\inifile] [//iniline]
                  [/D /E:nnnn /F /L /LA /LD /LH /P[:filename] /Q /S /T:bf
                  /X /Y] [[/C | /K] command]

             Do not include the square brackets shown in the command line
             above.  They are there to indicate that the items within the
             brackets are optional.  Not all options are available in all
             products; see below for details.

             If you include any of the options below, you should use them
             in the order that they are described.  If you do not do so,
             you may find that they do not operate properly.

             The following items can be included on the command line:

                  * d:\path\program:  The path and name of the executable
                    program file (4DOS.COM, 4OS2.EXE, or 4NT.EXE).  It is
                    required to start 4DOS, 4OS2, or 4NT.

                  * d:\path:  This is the second d:\path in the command
                    line above.  It sets the drive and directory where
                    the program is stored, called the COMSPEC path.
                    4DOS, 4OS2, and 4NT use this path to find their files

        ------------------------------------------------------------------


                    and to set the COMSPEC environment variable (see your
                    Reference Manual or online help for more information
                    on COMSPEC).

     4DOS           Under 4DOS, this option is generally required for the
                    primary shell, but not for secondary shells.  In some
                    cases the primary 4DOS shell can find its directory
                    automatically and this option is not needed, but we
                    recommend that you use it on all primary shells to
                    ensure that the directory is found.

                    If you are running Windows 3.x or Windows 95/98 and
                    you do not load 4DOS as the primary shell in
                    CONFIG.SYS, you must use this option in each desktop
                    object or shortcut command line to allow 4DOS to find
                    its files.

     4OS2,          4OS2 and 4NT normally know what drive and directory
     4NT            they are started from, so this option is not usually
                    necessary.

                  * @d:\path\inifile:  This option sets the path and name
                    of the .INI file.  You don't need this option if you
                    aren't using an .INI file at all, or if the file has
                    the default name (4DOS.INI, 4OS2.INI, or 4NT.INI) and
                    it is either in the same directory as the executable
                    program or in the root directory of the boot drive.
                    This option is most useful if you want to start the
                    program with a specific and unique .INI file.

                  * //iniline:  This option tells 4DOS, 4OS2, or 4NT to
                    treat the text appearing between the // and the next
                    space or tab as an .INI directive.  The directive
                    should be in the same format as a line in the .INI
                    file, but may not contain spaces, tabs, or comments.
                    Directives on the command line override any
                    corresponding directive in the .INI file.  This
                    option may be repeated.  It is a convenient way to
                    place a few simple directives on the startup line
                    without having to modify or create a new .INI file.

     4DOS         * /D:  In 4DOS only, this option disables execution of
                    AUTOEXEC.BAT (or the file named in the AutoExecPath
                    directive in 4DOS.INI).  It is intended for internal
                    use by MS-DOS / PC-DOS 6.x and 7.x (including Windows
                    95/98).  When you press the F8 key during the boot
                    process, MS-DOS prompts for whether to run
                    AUTOEXEC.BAT.  If you answer "No", the /D switch is
                    used to relay your choice to 4DOS.  This option is not
                    available in 4OS2 or 4NT.

        ------------------------------------------------------------------


     4DOS         * /E:nnnn:  In 4DOS only, this option sets the size of
                    the environment in bytes.  If you don't use this
                    option, 4DOS will allocate 512 bytes for the
                    environment.  You can use any value from 256 to 32000
                    as the environment size.  For example, to set an
                    environment of 1,000 bytes, you would enter the
                    option as /E:1000.

                    You can also set the environment size with the
                    Environment directive in the 4DOS.INI file (see your
                    Reference Manual or online help).  We recommend that
                    you use the directive instead of the /E switch, so
                    that all configuration information is kept in one
                    place in the 4DOS.INI file.

     4OS2,          4OS2 and 4NT allocate space in the environment
     4NT            dynamically instead of using a fixed amount of space.
                    Therefore, this option is not available in either
                    program.

     4DOS         * /F:  This option tells 4DOS to automatically provide
                    a Fail response to all critical errors, without
                    prompting or waiting for a user response.  It is
                    rarely used except on systems that must run
                    unattended, like bulletin boards.  We do not
                    recommend use of this option on a normal system,
                    because you will not have a chance to react to a
                    critical error and correct the problem that caused
                    it.  For more information on critical errors see
                    Chapter 3 of your Reference Manual, or the online
                    help.  /F only affects critical errors detected by
                    4DOS, and will not affect critical error handling for
                    many application programs which perform this function
                    themselves.  It is equivalent to the directive
                    CritFail=Yes in 4DOS.INI.

                    The /F option is not available in 4OS2 or 4NT.

                  * /L, /LA, /LD, and /LH:  These options force 4DOS,
                    4OS2, or 4NT to use a local alias, directory history,
                    and / or command history list.  They can be used to
                    override any LocalAlias=No, LocalHistory=No, or
                    LocalDirHistory=No settings in the .INI file.  This
                    allows you to use global lists as the default, but
                    start a specific shell or session with local aliases
                    or histories.  See your Reference Manual or online
                    help for details on local and global aliases and
                    histories.  /LA forces local aliases, /LD forces
                    local directory history, /LH forces local command

     4DOS         * /P[:filename]:  This option tells 4DOS to load
                    permanently and to run AUTOEXEC.BAT.  If you specify
                    a filename after the /P, that file will be run
                    instead of AUTOEXEC.BAT.  You should specify the full
                    name of the file, including drive and directory.  A
                    filename after /P will override the AutoExecPath
                    option in 4DOS.INI.

                    When 4DOS is loaded from the SHELL= command in
                    CONFIG.SYS, or as the shell for an OS/2 DOS session,
                    it will normally detect that it is the primary shell
                    and set the /P option automatically.  Under very rare
                    circumstances, you may want to load 4DOS permanently
                    and have it run AUTOEXEC.BAT even though you are not
                    loading it from CONFIG.SYS; in such cases you must
                    set /P yourself.  4DOS will not run AUTOEXEC.BAT
                    without either an automatic or an explicit /P.  Do
                    not use this option in secondary shells, or you will
                    be unable to return to the primary shell.

                    The /P option is not available in 4OS2 or 4NT.

     4NT          * /Q:  This option, which is only available in 4NT, has
                    no effect.  It is included only for compatibility
                    with CMD.EXE.

     4NT,         * /S:  This option tells 4OS2 or 4NT that you do not
     4OS2           want it to set up a Ctrl-C / Ctrl-Break handler.  It
                    is included for compatibility with CMD.EXE, but it
                    may cause the system to operate incorrectly if you
                    use this option without other software to handle
                    Ctrl-C and Ctrl-Break.  This option should be avoided
                    by most users.  It is not available under 4DOS.

     4NT          * /T:bf:  This option sets the foreground and
                    background colors in the 4NT window.  Both b and f
                    are hexadecimal digits; b specifies the background
                    color and f specifies the foreground color.  This
                    option is included only for compatibility with
                    CMD.EXE; in most cases you should set default colors
                    with the StdColors directive in 4NT.INI, or the
                    corresponding Output Colors option on the Display
                    page of the OPTION command's configuration dialogs.

     4NT          * /X:  This option forces 4NT to alter the operation of
                    the MD and MKDIR command to automatically create all
                    necessary intermediate directories when it creates a

                    new subdirectory.  Its effect is the same as adding a
                    /S option to all MD and MKDIR commands (see the
                    Reference Manual or online help for details about the
                    MD /S command).  This option is included for
                    compatibility with CMD.EXE.  In CMD.EXE it enables
                    other options as well, but in 4NT the only option not
                    enabled by default is the implicit MD /S.

     4DOS         * /Y:  This option forces 4DOS to enable the batch file
                    debugger for 4START and AUTOEXEC.BAT (or the file
                    named in the AutoExecPath directive in 4DOS.INI).  It
                    is intended for internal use by MS-DOS / PC-DOS 6.x
                    and 7.x (Windows 95/98).  When you press the F8 key to
                    enable single-stepping during the boot process and
                    then elect to single-step through AUTOEXEC.BAT, the /Y
                    switch is used to relay your choice to 4DOS.  This
                    option is not available in 4OS2 or 4NT.

                  * [/C | /K] command:  This option tells 4DOS, 4OS2, or
                    4NT to run a specific command after starting.  The
                    command will be run after 4START, and after
                    AUTOEXEC.BAT in a 4DOS primary shell.  The command
                    will be run before the prompt is displayed.  The
                    command can be any valid alias, internal or external
                    command, or batch file.  All other startup options
                    must be placed before the command, because the
                    command interpreter will treat characters after the
                    command as part of the command and not as additional
                    startup options.

                    When the command is preceded by a /C, 4DOS, 4OS2, or
                    4NT will execute the command and then exit and return
                    to the parent program or the desktop without
                    displaying a prompt.  This is sometimes called a
                    "transient" command interpreter session.

                    In 4OS2 and 4NT, and in 4DOS when it is started as a
                    secondary shell (for example from the Windows
                    desktop), the /K switch has no effect; using it is
                    the same as placing the command (without a /C or /K)
                    at the end of the startup command line.  It is
                    included only for compatibility with COMMAND.COM  and
                    CMD.EXE.

     4DOS           When you start 4DOS from the SHELL= line in MS-DOS /
                    PC-DOS 6.x and use /K, the command will be executed
                    instead of AUTOEXEC.BAT (for compatibility with MS-
                    DOS / PC-DOS 6.x COMMAND.COM).  This behavior occurs
                    only in MS-DOS / PC-DOS 6.x, not in other DOS
                    versions or in Windows 95/98.

             For example, this command line will start 4DOS, execute any
             4START file you have created, execute the file START.BTM, and
             then display the prompt:

                  c:\4dos600\4dos.exe c:\4dos600\start.btm

             This command line will start 4OS2, select local aliases,
             execute any 4START file you have created, execute the file
             PROCESS.BTM, and then exit when PROCESS.BTM is done.  The
             prompt will not be displayed by this session:

                  c:\4os2\4os2.exe /la /c c:\4os2\process.btm


        Creating or Modifying Startup Files

             Each of our products uses two files to control the way it
             starts:  a file of configuration information called the .INI
             file (named 4DOS.INI, 4OS2.INI, or 4NT.INI), and a startup
             batch file called 4START (depending on your operating system,
             4START may have the extension .BTM, .BAT, or .CMD).

             The .INI file is optional, except in 4DOS (see page 39 for
             details).  A small default .INI file may be created during
             the installation process in some cases.  The .INI file for
             each command processor should be placed in the same directory
             as the other files for that product.  You can add additional
             information to the .INI file manually with an ASCII editor,
             or you can use the OPTION command to aid you in selecting
             configuration options.

             The 4START file is also optional.  It is executed each time
             4DOS, 4OS2, or 4NT starts, and gives you a convenient way to
             load aliases and environment variables, and otherwise
             initialize the command processor - especially under 4NT and
             4OS2, which do not use an AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  4START is
             normally placed in the same directory as the other product
             files, but this may vary if you use the same 4START file for
             more than one product.

             For complete details on startup files, on the OPTION command,
             and on the 4EXIT file (executed when the command processor
             exits), see your Reference Manual or the online help.

             If you are upgrading from a previous version of 4DOS, 4OS2,
             or 4NT, you may have a .INI file and / or a 4START (or 4EXIT)
             file in the previous version's directory.  To use these files
             with your new version, you must copy them to the new
             directory, and then update any paths in either file which
             point to the old program directory.

        Chapter 5 / 4DOS Configuration and Notes


        4DOS works well with virtually all PC hardware; with a wide range
        of operating systems and environments, including MS DOS, PC-DOS,
        Novell DOS / OpenDOS, Windows 3.x, Windows 95/98, and OS/2 (see
        page 1 for a complete list); and with all DOS-based,
        Windows-based, and OS/2-based networks.  Each environment makes
        different demands on 4DOS and the user.

        4DOS is not recommended for use under Windows NT, or supported in
        that environment.  If you are running Windows NT, use our 32-bit
        Windows NT command interpreter, 4NT.

        This chapter provides the basic information you need to run 4DOS
        in any of the standard PC environments.  If you need more detailed
        technical information or troubleshooting assistance on any of
        these topics, consult the Troubleshooting, Service, and Support
        and Compatibility topics in the 4DOS online help.

        If you are running under DOS and do not use Windows, Windows
        95/98, OS/2, or a network, you can safely skip this chapter, and
        return to it only if you have difficulty with 4DOS or questions
        about how it interacts with other software.


        4DOS Installation Notes

             When you install 4DOS, your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files
             must be modified.  You can allow the installation software to
             make these changes automatically, or you can make them
             yourself at a later time (see Manual Installation of 4DOS
             below for details).

             When installing 4DOS under Windows 95/98, we also strongly
             recommend that you use a short name for the 4DOS directory
             (i.e. a name where each element of the path uses more than
             eight characters for the name and three characters for the
             extension, with no white space or other special characters).
             If you install 4DOS in a directory with a long name, you will
             have to determine the equivalent short name and use it
             throughout the installation process.

             If you install 4DOS under Windows 95/98, the installation
             program will create a Start menu group for JP Software
             products, including 4DOS.  In addition, a small group of
             entries will be added to the system registry (if you allow
             such modifications); for more details see page 47.

                                  Chapter 5 / 4DOS Configuration and Notes
        ------------------------------------------------------------------


             If you install 4DOS in an OS/2 DOS session, the OS/2
             CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files will be modified to use
             4DOS as your default command processor for OS/2 DOS sessions
             (if you allow such modifications).

             Installing 4DOS does not modify, remove, or otherwise alter
             any of your other system files.


             Older Versions of DOS

             If you're running DOS 5 or earlier, we recommend that you
             make a bootable system diskette before you install 4DOS (or
             any other software, for that matter).  This allows you to
             recover in case of a power failure, error, or other
             interruption during the installation process.  See your DOS
             documentation for details about creating a bootable floppy
             disk.

             In DOS 6 and above and in Windows 95/98, a bootable disk
             usually is not necessary because the F5 and F8 keys can be
             used to skip steps in the boot process and recover from
             errors in configuration files.  In OS/2, a bootable disk
             usually is not necessary because the operating system will
             boot normally whether the DOS command interpreter is
             completely installed or not.


        Manual Installation of 4DOS

             This section is for advanced users, and assumes you are
             generally familiar with CONFIG.SYS, AUTOEXEC.BAT, and other
             concepts such as ASCII editors and batch files.  In most
             cases, manual installation is not necessary because you can
             select the installation options you need using the automated
             installation program.

             In order to install 4DOS manually, you must extract or copy
             the necessary files, brand 4DOS if necessary, create or
             modify any configuration files you need, and then create the
             necessary commands to start the program on your system.


             Extracting or Copying the Program Files

             When you extract or copy the 4DOS files, be sure to place
             them in their own directory, rather than using the same
             directory as a previous version of the program, a directory
             used by other JP Software products, or a directory used by
             other software.

                                  Chapter 5 / 4DOS Configuration and Notes
        ------------------------------------------------------------------


             We strongly recommend that you place all of the 4DOS files in
             the same directory.  See 4DOS Files and Directories on page
             40 for some important considerations if you choose not to
             follow this recommendation.

             The method used to extract or copy the files depends on how
             you obtained your copy of the program:

                  * If you have a JP Software diskette you must use the
                    installation program to extract the files, which are
                    compressed on the distribution disk.  You cannot
                    simply copy the files onto your hard disk.  Select
                    Custom Install and follow the prompts to specify the
                    installation directory and copy the files.  Then exit
                    the installation program with Ctrl-X, or answer No
                    when prompted for whether to proceed with each
                    additional step.

                  * If you have a copy purchased electronically you must
                    use the installation program to extract the files as
                    described above.  First extract the installation
                    files from the compressed file you downloaded into a
                    temporary directory, then run the INSTALL program.
                    Use the Custom Install option as described in the
                    preceding paragraph.

                  * If you have the JP CD Suite, all of the files are
                    stored uncompressed on the CD, in the \4DOS
                    directory, and you can copy them manually if you
                    wish.  However, we still recommend that you use the
                    installation program to copy the files.  Some files
                    may be renamed after copying, and some files are used
                    only during the installation process and do not need
                    to be copied to your hard disk.  If you copy the
                    files manually, a few may not have the correct names,
                    and you may copy more files than you need, resulting
                    in wasted hard disk space.

                  * If you have a downloaded trial copy of the program,
                    or a copy distributed on a CD or diskette of trial
                    software, extract the files into a new directory
                    using the appropriate decompression program (e.g.
                    PKUNZIP).


             "Branding" 4DOS

             (If you are not familiar with branding, refer to the general
             information on page 21 before continuing with this section.)

             installation procedure will normally run the BR4DOS program
             to check your name, serial number, and validation code and
             "brand" 4DOS as a registered product (in some cases 4DOS may
             not operate properly until this step is completed).  If you
             need to brand 4DOS manually, go to a 4DOS or COMMAND.COM
             prompt, change to the directory where 4DOS is stored, and
             enter the command:

                  c:\4dos600> br4dos

             Follow the instructions displayed by BR4DOS to enter your
             name, serial number, and validation code.  All information
             must be entered exactly as shown on your original brand card,
             label, or electronically delivered branding information; you
             cannot change spelling, capitalization, or punctuation.


             Updating CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT

             (Please Note:  If you installed 4DOS to a directory with a
             long name under Windows 95/98, you must determine the
             equivalent short name for use when updating CONFIG.SYS and
             AUTOEXEC.BAT.  Paths in these files can not be entered in
             long name form.)

             When you're ready to finish installing 4DOS, you need to add
             one line to your DOS, Windows 95/98, or OS/2 CONFIG.SYS file:

                  SHELL=d:\path\4DOS.COM d:\path /P

             "d:\path" means the drive and directory where 4DOS.COM is
             stored.  The second "d:\path" on the SHELL= line should be
             the same as the first, and is used to set the COMSPEC
             environment variable properly.  Be sure to delete or REMark
             out any old SHELL= line for COMMAND.COM after you add the new
             SHELL= line for 4DOS.

             You can add any command line options to the end of the line.
             See Chapter 4 on page 28 for information on command line
             options.

             If you are running 4DOS under DOS 4.01 or earlier, you must
             make sure that the portion of the SHELL= line beginning with
             the second "d:\path", through the end of the line, does not
             exceed 31 characters, due to a bug in DOS.  For details, see
             the Compatibility section in the online help.

             If you are running 4DOS under OS/2, change CONFIG.SYS as
             described above (don't forget to find and REMark out or
             delete the old SHELL= line).  Once you reboot, 4DOS will be

        ------------------------------------------------------------------


             used automatically for all DOS objects which use the default
             DOS_SHELL settings.  See page 50 for more details on
             configuring OS/2 DOS sessions to use 4DOS.

             Next, if you are running under DOS, OS/2, or Windows 3.x, add
             the following line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

                  d:\path\KSTACK.COM

             where "d:\path" is the drive and directory where your 4DOS
             files are stored.  KSTACK.COM is a memory-resident program
             used to support the KEYSTACK command.  It requires about 1K
             of memory, and can be left out of AUTOEXEC.BAT if you do not
             use KEYSTACK.

             Do not add the KSTACK line to AUTOEXEC.BAT if you are using
             Windows 95/98.  Under Windows 95, KSTACK should be loaded
             separately for each 4DOS session; see page 48 for details.

             If you have a line in AUTOEXEC.BAT which sets the COMSPEC
             environment variable to point to COMMAND.COM, remove it or
             REMark it out.  If you set up the CONFIG.SYS file properly,
             4DOS will set this variable automatically; setting it in
             AUTOEXEC.BAT is likely to cause trouble later on (for
             example, if you install an update to 4DOS in a different
             directory, but forget to change the COMSPEC setting).

             If you have a line in AUTOEXEC.BAT which copies COMMAND.COM
             to a RAM disk for faster reloading when an application
             program ends, remove it or REMark it out.  Using a similar
             command with 4DOS is not necessary; see the Swapping
             directive in Chapter 5 of the Reference Manual, or in the
             online help, for details about how 4DOS reloads itself.

             When you've finished modifying CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT,
             you can reboot your system to start 4DOS.


             Creating or Copying 4DOS.INI

             (For general information on the .INI file see page 34.)

             4DOS requires a 4DOS.INI file with at least one line in it:

                  InstallPath = d:\path

             where "d:\path" is the drive and directory where your 4DOS
             files are stored (under Windows 95/98, this must be the short
             name of the directory; long names cannot be used).  This will
             help 4DOS locate its auxiliary files, such as the help files

                                  Chapter 5 / 4DOS Configuration and Notes
        ------------------------------------------------------------------


             and OPTION.EXE.  The automated installation process always
             places this line in 4DOS.INI.  If you need to create the file
             manually, you can do so with any ASCII file editor.  The
             InstallPath setting should be the first line in the file.

             If you are upgrading from a previous version of 4DOS, you
             should copy any 4DOS.INI file you have in the old directory
             to the new one.  Then add or modify the InstallPath directive
             at the beginning of 4DOS.INI, remove any HelpPath directive
             in the file (HelpPath is obsolete and has been replaced by
             InstallPath), and update any paths in the file which point to
             the old program directory (e.g. 4StartPath).


             4DOS Files and Directories

             We strongly recommend that you place all 4DOS files in the
             same directory.  If you do not do so, you will have to
             explicitly set the locations of 4DOS files to avoid problems.

             You may feel that you should place 4DOS.COM in the root
             directory because it is a system-related file.  We do not
             recommend this practice; 4DOS will run just fine from its own
             directory, and keeping it there makes configuration much
             simpler.

             If you do wish to move files to different directories, the
             following information will help you set up the programs
             correctly:

                  4DOS.COM is the 4DOS program file.  It must be in the
                  directory specified by the SHELL= line in your DOS,
                  Windows 95/98, or OS/2 CONFIG.SYS file, or the directory
                  specified on the command line in every desktop object
                  used to start 4DOS.

                  4HELP.EXE is the 4DOS help program.  For online help to
                  work, this file must be in the 4DOS installation
                  directory shown in the InstallPath directive in
                  4DOS.INI, or in a directory included in your PATH.

                  4DOS.HLP contains the text for the 4DOS help program.
                  It must be in the same directory as 4HELP.EXE, or in a
                  directory included in your PATH.

                  KSTACK.COM is the used by the KEYSTACK command.  If you
                  wish to use the KEYSTACK command, this file should be
                  loaded in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file (under DOS, Windows
                  3.x, and OS/2) or separately for each 4DOS session
                  (Windows 95/98).  This file does not have to be in the

                  4DOS directory.  If KSTACK.COM has not been loaded, you
                  will see an error message when you attempt to use the
                  KEYSTACK command.

                  OPTION.EXE is a utility used by the OPTION command to
                  configure 4DOS.  For the OPTION command to work, this
                  file must be in the 4DOS installation directory shown in
                  the InstallPath directive in 4DOS.INI, or in a directory
                  included in your PATH.


        The 4DOS Help System

             The 4DOS help program is called 4HELP.EXE; the help text is
             stored in the file 4DOS.HLP.  The 4DOS help system provides
             complete help for 4DOS commands and features; on most systems
             it can also launch the DOS help program to display help on
             external DOS commands like FORMAT or SORT.

             The section entitled The 4DOS Help System within the help
             system itself explains navigation keystrokes and mouse usage
             in more detail, as well as instructions on linking the help
             system to DOS help or other help programs.

             If you do not have 4DOS running, you can start the help
             system by moving into the directory that contains your 4DOS
             files (we assume that you are using C:\4DOS600 in this
             example) and typing this command:

                  C:\4DOS600> 4help

             You can use this command if you are unable to install 4DOS
             completely for some reason; information in the help system
             will likely help you solve the problem.

             4OS2 also supports the /? switch to display help for any
             command.  Using /? will display brief help text for the
             command within the 4OS2 window.


        4DOS and Your Computer

             4DOS will work on any IBM PC-compatible hardware, regardless
             of the CPU type, amount of memory (assuming the minimum 256K
             or so required to run 4DOS is available), disk configuration,
             or video hardware.  The notes below briefly cover memory,
             video, and disk issues.

        ------------------------------------------------------------------


             Memory

             4DOS knows how to use XMS memory, EMS memory, and Upper
             Memory Blocks (UMBs) in order to minimize the amount of space
             it takes in the 640K of DOS memory available to your
             application programs.  You can control 4DOS's memory usage
             with directives in the 4DOS.INI file.  For more details about
             configuring 4DOS's memory usage see Initialization Directives
             under .INI File Directives in the 4DOS.INI section of the
             online help.  You can also set most memory usage options
             easily from the Startup page of the OPTION command's dialogs.

             By default, 4DOS uses normal DOS memory ("low memory") for
             its small resident portion of about 3 - 4K.  4DOS can reduce
             its low memory usage by moving most of this information to
             Upper Memory Blocks (UMBs), when requested with UMBLoad and
             other UMB-related directives in the 4DOS.INI file.

             Low memory is also used to hold the larger (about 200K)
             transient portion of 4DOS while your system is at the prompt,
             or executing an internal 4DOS command or batch file.  When an
             external application is running 4DOS moves its transient
             portion to EMS or XMS memory (or the hard disk), so the
             memory is available to the application.  For additional
             details see the Reference Manual or online help, and in
             particular the documentation on the Swapping directive in
             4DOS.INI.


             Video

             4DOS can normally adjust itself to your video hardware
             automatically, regardless of your video adapter and the
             number of rows and columns on your screen.

             Most video problems turn out to be unrelated to 4DOS, and are
             often due to the underlying operating environment (for
             example, attempting to display blinking text in a window when
             the underlying environment does not support this feature).

             If you experience scrolling or color problems, you should
             also check whether you have an ANSI driver installed, and if
             so verify that it is configured correctly and can support
             your video hardware.


             Disk Drives

             4DOS supports all types of disks including floppy disks, hard
             disks, high-capacity removable disks, compressed drives,

        ------------------------------------------------------------------
        Copr. 1999 JP Software Inc.     4DOS, 4OS2, 4NT Install Guide / 42

                                  Chapter 5 / 4DOS Configuration and Notes
        ------------------------------------------------------------------


             network drives, and RAM disks.  4DOS never directly modifies
             the FAT, root directory, subdirectories, or other system
             areas of the disk, and it doesn't write any data on your disk
             itself.  It always calls on DOS to perform these actions,
             just like most application programs do.  As a result, 4DOS is
             compatible with all disk sizes, formats, and structures that
             your DOS version supports.

             If you receive unexpected results related to a disk drive or
             disk file (for example, an apparent error in the amount of
             free space on a drive, or an "access denied" message when
             attempting to use a file you thought was available), chances
             are that 4DOS is merely reporting information provided by the
             operating system, and is not the original source of the
             problem.


        4DOS and DOS

             4DOS is compatible with MS-DOS or PC-DOS 3.1 and above, DR
             DOS / Novell DOS / OpenDOS 3.4 and above, Windows 95/98 (and
             its built-in version of DOS, "MS-DOS 7"), and OS/2 DOS
             sessions.  See page 45 for additional important information
             on Windows 95/98, and page 50 for information on OS/2.

             More detailed information on 4DOS and DOS is covered in the
             Compatibility section of the online help.  If you use any of
             the DOS versions or features listed below, you may want to
             check that topic for additional information.  This is only a
             partial list of the DOS-related items discussed in the online
             help.  Inclusion of an item here does not mean it is
             incompatible with 4DOS, but only that more information on it
             is available in the help system.  The help system includes
             information you may need if you use:

                  * Any version of DR DOS, Novell DOS, or OpenDOS.

                  * Utilities which allow multiple configurations in your

        4DOS and Microsoft Windows 3.x

             This section applies to Microsoft Windows 3.x, including
             Windows for Workgroups.  See the next section for information
             on Windows 95/98.  For additional details on using 4DOS with
             Windows see the Compatibility section in the online help.

             4DOS works well as both the primary shell, loaded before
             Windows, and as a secondary shell loaded inside any window.
             It works in both Standard and Enhanced modes.

             If you plan to run 4DOS under Windows we strongly recommend
             that you install it as the primary shell in CONFIG.SYS (this
             is the way 4DOS is normally installed).  If you do not
             install 4DOS as the primary shell, individual 4DOS sessions
             will not be able to share global alias, command history, and
             directory history lists; each 4DOS session will have to
             process the .INI file before it starts; and, if you have two
             or more 4DOS sessions running simultaneously from the Windows
             desktop, they will use more system resources than they would
             if 4DOS were installed as the primary shell.

             To run 4DOS from within Windows, you will need to create a
             new "4DOS" item on your Program Manager desktop.  The generic
             "MS-DOS Prompt" item supplied by Microsoft runs COMMAND.COM;
             we recommend that you leave this icon's properties unchanged,
             and create a new item for 4DOS.

             You can set up a 4DOS item from the Program Manager's File /
             New menu selection.  To do so, simply create a new program
             item and set the command line to d:\path\4DOS.COM (use the
             appropriate drive and path for your system).    Use the
             Change Icon button to assign the standard 4DOS icon, in the
             file 4DOS.ICO, to the shortcut (use 4DOSM.ICO for monochrome
             displays).

             You can put command-line switches, a command, or the name of
             a batch file at the end of the command line for any 4DOS
             item.  This allows you to run specific commands or set
             configuration options when you start 4DOS from that item.
             However, no additional settings are required; the only
             required item is the drive and path for 4DOS.COM.  For
             details on the command line options available for 4DOS items

             see Chapter 4, and the Starting 4DOS section of the online
             help.

             If you use an alternate Windows shell, such as Norton Desktop
             for Windows, see the documentation for your shell to
             determine how to set up a new desktop object and assign an
             icon to it.

             For more flexibility, you can use the Windows PIF editor to
             create or modify a 4DOS.PIF file.  We have included a sample
             .PIF file on the distribution diskette.  You must modify this
             file and make it correspond to your system configuration,
             including the directory that contains 4DOS, before you use
             it.


        4DOS and Microsoft Windows 95/98

             This section provides basic information on using 4DOS under
             Windows 95/98.  For additional details see the Compatibility
             section in the online help.

             4DOS works well as both the primary shell, loaded before
             Windows 95/98, and when loaded from the Windows 95/98 GUI.

             If you are using 4DOS under Windows 95/98, we strongly
             recommend that you install it as the primary shell in
             CONFIG.SYS (this is the way 4DOS is normally installed).  If
             you do not install 4DOS as the primary shell, individual 4DOS
             sessions will not be able to share global alias, command
             history, and directory history lists; each 4DOS session will
             have to process the .INI file before it starts; and, if you
             have two or more 4DOS sessions running simultaneously from
             the Windows 95/98 desktop, they will use more system
             resources than they would if 4DOS were installed as the
             primary shell.

             If you have a typical Windows 95/98 configuration, and
             install 4DOS as the primary shell, generally you must have an
             AUTOEXEC.BAT file, even if it only consists of a single REM
             statement.  In most cases Windows 95/98 will not load the
             primary shell if it cannot find an AUTOEXEC.BAT file in the
             root directory of your Windows 95/98 boot drive.


             Installing 4DOS Under Windows 95/98

             The 4DOS installation program will install and configure 4DOS
             correctly for Windows 95/98.  If you are installing 4DOS
             manually, follow the instructions under Manual Installation
             on page 36.

                                  Chapter 5 / 4DOS Configuration and Notes
        ------------------------------------------------------------------


             If you reinstall Windows 95/98, your SHELL= line will be
             removed from CONFIG.SYS by the Windows 95/98 installation
             process.  To correct this, simply boot the new version and
             use Notepad or another ASCII editor to put the SHELL= line
             back in CONFIG.SYS as described in the manual installation
             instructions on page 36, then restart Windows 95/98.

             If you load Windows 95/98 in "safe mode" your startup files
             (CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT) are ignored, and 4DOS will not
             be loaded as the primary shell.  When you start Windows 95/98
             in "safe mode," in most cases you should NOT load 4DOS after
             the GUI starts.  DOS applications often do not work properly
             in "safe mode."


             Creating 4DOS Shortcuts

             When 4DOS is installed it normally creates a JP Software
             program group which appears on the Start Menu under Programs,
             and includes items to start 4DOS and its online help.  The
             installation program also creates a desktop shortcut for
             4DOS.  These entries are created by the file JP4DOSSC.INF,
             which is distributed with 4DOS.

             If you have a downloaded trial copy of 4DOS, JP4DOSSC.INF may
             not be installed automatically; if you want to install it you
             may need to do so manually.  See the comments below and in
             the file for additional details.

             If you need to create a similar program group or shortcuts
             manually - for example, if the JP Software group on the Start
             menu is inadvertently damaged or deleted -  you can use the
             Windows Explorer's facilities for creating shortcuts and
             modifying the desktop and / or the Start menu (see below).
             You can also reinstall JP4DOSSC.INF manually if you wish;
             see the comments in the file for details.

             To remove the desktop shortcuts and group created by
             JP4DOSSC.INF, open the Windows Control Panel and select Add
             / Remove Programs.  Select the item listed as "JP Software
             4DOS shortcuts (remove only)" and click the Add / Remove
             button.  The 4DOS shortcuts will be removed without further
             prompting, and the group will be removed if it becomes
             empty.  The removal operation may not work correctly if you
             modified the group or shortcuts manually after they were
             created.

             If you want to create additional shortcuts elsewhere on the
             Start menu, or modify the Programs entries, click mouse
             button 2 in an open area of the Task Bar, and select
             Properties on the popup menu.  Select the Start Menu Programs
             tab and modify or adjust the menus as required.

             You can also manually create one or more shortcuts on the
             desktop to run 4DOS.  To do so click with mouse button 2 in
             any open area of the desktop.  On the popup menu click New,
             then Shortcut.  Fill in the drive and path as
             d:\path\4DOS.COM (use the appropriate drive and path for your
             system).  Add any other command line options you wish to set
             to the end of the line.

             You can also put command-line switches, a command, or the
             name of a batch file at the end of the command line for any
             shortcut.  This allows you to run specific commands or set
             configuration options when you start 4DOS from that shortcut.
             For details on the command line options available, see
             Chapter 4 and the Starting 4DOS section of the online help.

             For more information on creating and configuring shortcuts or
             modifying the Start Menu, see your Windows 95/98
             documentation.


             Windows 95/98 Registry Extensions for 4DOS

             JP Software distributes a file of registry extensions for
             4DOS, for use under Windows 95/98 (for information on
             registry changes for the Start menu and desktop shortcuts,
             see the previous section).  The registry extensions are
             stored in JP4DOS.INF.  Installing these extensions will:

                  * Designate 4DOS .BTM files (enhanced batch files) as
                    batch files.  They will then be recognized as such by
                    the Windows Explorer;

                  * Provide an additional "open" option in the context
                    (mouse button 2) menu of all batch files, to
                    explicitly run the file with 4DOS; and

                  * Create a new entry in the context menu of drives and
                    directories to launch 4DOS in that drive / directory.

             You will have the option to install JP4DOS.INF automatically
             during the 4DOS installation process.  You can also install

        ------------------------------------------------------------------


             it manually by opening the 4DOS directory from within the
             Windows Explorer, clicking on JP4DOS.INF with mouse button 2,
             and selecting INSTALL from the popup menu.  If you have a
             downloaded trial copy of 4DOS, JP4DOS.INF will not be
             installed automatically; you must use manual installation.
             See the comments in the file for additional details.

             JP4DOS.INF assumes that you have a relatively standard system
             configuration.  If you have modified basic items in your
             registry (such as the characteristics of the system file type
             "batfile"), the registry extensions may not work correctly.

             To adjust the registry entries made when you install
             JP4DOS.INF, open the Windows Explorer, and select Options on
             the View menu.  Click on the File Types tab and find the
             listing for batch files (typically under "MS-DOS Batch
             File").  Use the Edit button to adjust this listing.
             JP4DOS.INF also makes minor changes to the Drive and
             Directory types; you may want to modify these as well.  Note
             that some of these file types may not be editable on your
             system, depending on the settings of various edit flags in
             the registry.

             To remove the registry entries created by JP4DOS.INF, open
             the Windows Control Panel and select Add / Remove Programs.
             Select the item listed as "JP Software's 4DOS Registry
             Extensions (remove only)" and click the Add / Remove button.
             The registry extensions will be removed without further
             prompting.  The removal operation may not work correctly if
             you modified the registry entries manually after they were
             created.

             JP Software's Take Command/32 also includes a .INF file which
             creates registry extensions, some of which are the same as
             those used by 4DOS.  Therefore, if you remove the 4DOS
             extensions you will also remove some extensions used by Take
             Command/32.  If this causes a problem, you can correct it by
             manually reinstalling the Take Command/32 extensions after
             removing those for 4DOS.


             Installing the KSTACK Program in Windows 95/98

             If you want to load KSTACK.COM (required for the KEYSTACK
             command) it should be loaded separately for each 4DOS session
             in Windows 95/98.  To do so, include the KSTACK command as
             the last item on the startup command line when you set up the
             corresponding shortcut(s).  For example, the command line for
             your shortcut might read:


        ------------------------------------------------------------------

                                  Chapter 5 / 4DOS Configuration and Notes
        ------------------------------------------------------------------


                  c:\4dos600\4dos.com c:\4dos600\kstack.com

             This will load KSTACK when the 4DOS window is opened, then
             display a prompt.

             If you install KSTACK in AUTOEXEC.BAT, it may not work
             properly when multiple 4DOS windows are open, as stacked
             keystrokes may "bleed through" from one window to another.

             You can also address this issue by loading KSTACK in your
             4START file (see page 34), and using an IF command to make
             sure it is not loaded from AUTOEXEC.BAT in the primary shell.
             To do so, use a line like this in 4START:

                  if %_shell ne 0 c:\4dos600\kstack.com


        Using 4DOS on a Network

             This section will give you some tips on using 4DOS on a
             network, and on the proper locations for 4DOS files on a
             network.  For additional details, and any additional
             information about compatibility with your particular network,
             see the Compatibility section in the online help.

             In general, you'll find that you can load and run your
             network software normally under 4DOS.  Network drives will be
             accessible as normal drives once the network is loaded, and
             files on the network will be accessible just as if they were
             on a local hard disk.

             Some networks support file and directory names beginning with
             a double backslash [\\], also called "UNC" names, or with a
             server name followed by a colon, to identify files by their
             location on the network.  4DOS detects such names and passes
             them through to the network unaltered, allowing the network
             software to process them.

             Some networks support server disk partitions which exceed the
             standard DOS 2 GB partition size limit.  On these drives,
             4DOS may not be able to return proper free space or total
             space figures because the drive size information returned by
             DOS is not accurate.  If you have such a drive you may need
             to use a network or server utility to obtain accurate
             partition size and free space information.

             If you need to boot a diskless workstation from a network
             drive, see the Novell Netware topic under Software in the
             Compatibility section of the online help.  The techniques
             described there will allow you to set your system up under

             Netware to avoid accesses to the boot drive once 4DOS is
             running, and can generally be used for other networks as
             well.


             4DOS and Novell Netware

             4DOS includes a special 4DOS.INI directive for Netware called
             NetwareNames. You must set NetwareNames = Yes on systems
             which load Netware, in order to avoid problems with destroyed
             environment variables during LOGIN.  See the Compatibility
             topic in the online help for more information.

             4DOS can also be set up to run on Novell Netware diskless
             workstations which boot from the server.  To do so, you must
             make several changes to 4DOS.INI and your other startup
             files; see the Compatibility section of the online help for
             complete details.


        Using 4DOS Under OS/2

             4DOS offers almost unlimited flexibility for your OS/2 DOS
             sessions, and has been specifically designed to take
             advantage of OS/2 features wherever possible.  However, to
             use DOS, 4DOS, and OS/2 successfully requires some planning
             if you want to get all the power possible out of each
             operating environment.

             This section explains some of the planning you should do and
             some of the techniques you can use to get everything working
             together correctly; you can find more advanced information in
             the Compatibility section of the online help.


             OS/2 Virtual DOS Machines (VDMs)

             Under OS/2, you can have multiple desktop objects which start
             DOS sessions, also called Virtual DOS Machines (VDMs).  These
             may include objects in the Command Prompts window, objects
             for "migrated applications," objects for DOS and Windows
             applications, and objects for batch files.

             Assuming you set up your VDM objects as described in the
             following section, 4DOS will be loaded as the shell each time
             a DOS session starts.  4DOS will process 4DOS.INI, execute
             your 4START file if you have one, and execute AUTOEXEC.BAT.
             You can start any number of DOS sessions and (within the
             limits of system resources) have as many running
             simultaneously as you like.

        ------------------------------------------------------------------


             This is fundamentally different from what happens when you
             boot your computer under DOS or Windows 95/98.  In those
             environments there is only one 4DOS primary shell,
             AUTOEXEC.BAT is only executed once each time you boot, and so
             on.

             OS/2 gives you much more flexibility, but that flexibility
             requires planning to get the most out of 4DOS.  For example,
             you can have all your DOS sessions use the same AUTOEXEC.BAT
             file, or you can have different versions of AUTOEXEC.BAT for
             different sessions.  The same is true of the other startup
             and exit files (4DOS.INI, 4START, and 4EXIT).

             Each VDM object contains its own information about how to
             start DOS and 4DOS for that session.  In essence, each object
             has its own CONFIG.SYS file built into it.  The information
             attached to an object which indicates how to start DOS is
             called its DOS Properties or DOS Settings.

             You can modify these settings using the OS/2 Settings or
             Properties notebook for each object.  Use the Program page of
             the notebook to modify the object's program name, startup
             directory, and command line parameters.  The Session page
             lets you set the session type.  Other pages let you adjust
             other configuration data for the object.

             In a new object, each DOS setting starts out with a default
             value taken from your CONFIG.SYS file.  For settings which
             have no corresponding command in CONFIG.SYS, OS/2 uses a
             built-in default value.  The DOS_SHELL setting, which
             specifies the command interpreter to use for a DOS session,
             defaults to the value on the SHELL= line in CONFIG.SYS.

             The following section explains how to create OS/2 desktop
             objects for 4DOS.


             Creating OS/2 Desktop Objects for 4DOS

             This section assumes you are running OS/2 Warp 4, with the
             default desktop shell and a standard OS/2 desktop.  If you
             are using an earlier version of OS/2 or a different shell, or
             have altered your OS/2 desktop configuration substantially,
             you will need to take those changes into account as you read
             the instructions below.

             The 4DOS installation program normally creates a desktop
             folder which contains an object to start 4DOS from your OS/2
             desktop.  If you want to create additional objects in other
             folders, or directly on the desktop, click mouse button 2 on

             the installed 4DOS object, select Copy on the popup menu, and
             copy the object to another location.  You can then alter the
             properties of the new object if you wish.

             If you need to create a new object for 4DOS, switch to the
             folder where you want the object to appear and either copy an
             existing object (use the Copy or Create Another selection on
             the object's popup menu) or drag a Program Template in from
             the Templates folder.  The new object's Properties notebook
             should open automatically.  Use the Program page of the
             notebook to modify the program name, parameters, and startup
             directory.

             To create a VDM object that gives you a standard 4DOS prompt,
             place an asterisk [*] in the Program Name field.  This tells
             OS/2 to load the command interpreter and go to a prompt
             instead of running a specific application.  Then go to the
             Session page and set the session type to DOS Full Screen or
             DOS Window.

             While you are on the Settings page, click on the DOS
             Properties or DOS Settings button.  4DOS will run properly
             with default DOS properties, but you may want to check that
             the DOS_SHELL setting is correct, because this determines
             which command interpreter OS/2 will load when the object is
             used to start a session.  The DOS_SHELL setting should be set
             as described for the SHELL= line in CONFIG.SYS (see page 38),
             for example:

                  c:\4dos600\4dos.com c:\4dos600 /p

             If you've set up CONFIG.SYS for 4DOS as described on page 38,
             any new VDM objects you create will automatically use the
             correct DOS_SHELL setting for 4DOS.  However, VDM objects
             which existed before you modified CONFIG.SYS may list
             COMMAND.COM in the DOS_SHELL setting.

             You can put command-line switches, a command, or the name of
             a batch file in the Parameters field (on the Program page of
             the notebook) for any object.  This allows you to run
             specific commands or set configuration options when you start
             4DOS from that object.  However, no additional settings are
             required; the only required item is the asterisk to tell OS/2
             to load the default command processor.  For details on the
             command line options available for 4DOS objects see Chapter
             4, and the Starting 4DOS section of the online help.

             If you precede a command name in the Parameters field with
             /C, 4DOS will exit and return to the OS/2 desktop when the
             command is finished.  This is a "temporary" VDM used to

             execute a single command or batch file.  Temporary VDMs are
             also created automatically by OS/2 if you set up an object
             with the Program Name set to the name of a DOS application.

             See the Compatibility section of the online help for
             additional information on using 4DOS under OS/2, including:

                  * More details on using temporary VDMs to run DOS
                    applications and batch files.

                  * Configuring 4DOS for Dual Boot and Boot Manager.

                  * Selecting different startup files (4DOS.INI,
                    AUTOEXEC.BAT, and 4START) for different DOS sessions.

                  * Why changing the DOS_SHELL setting for your DOS
                    session objects may cause difficulty later if you
                    update the SHELL= setting in CONFIG.SYS.


        Uninstalling 4DOS Manually

             For automated uninstall instructions, see page 23.

             The steps required to remove 4DOS from your system manually
             depend on the operating system you are using:

                  * If you are running 4DOS under Windows 95/98, and you
                    installed the 4DOS registry extensions, start by
                    removing them as described on page 48.

                  * Next, if you are running 4DOS under Windows 3.x,
                    Windows 95/98, or OS/2, change or delete any desktop
                    objects that refer directly to 4DOS.  Under Windows
                    95/98 you can use the Windows Explorer, or manually
                    uninstall JP4DOSSC.INF as described on page 46.

                  * Find the location of COMMAND.COM on your disk (for
                    example, in the root directory, or the DOS
                    directory).  Then use your editor to edit the
                    CONFIG.SYS file in the root directory of the boot
                    drive.  (If you are running DOS 5 or below, before
                    modifying the CONFIG.SYS file be sure you have a
                    bootable floppy disk as described on page 36).

                    Look for the line which begins with SHELL=, and
                    either delete it, or insert the characters "REM " at
                    the beginning of the line.  This converts the line

        ------------------------------------------------------------------


                    into a "remark" or comment.  Next, add a new line
                    like this:

                         SHELL=d:\path\COMMAND.COM d:\path /P

                    where "d:\path" is the drive and directory for
                    COMMAND.COM (this same directory name is repeated
                    after the full name of COMMAND.COM and before the
                    /P).  If you were previously running COMMAND.COM with
                    a /E:nnnn switch to set the size of your environment,
                    add it to this line as well.

                  * After CONFIG.SYS has been modified, edit your
                    AUTOEXEC.BAT file to remove any changes made to
                    accommodate 4DOS.  Look for a command beginning SET
                    COMSPEC= and another which loads the 4DOS file
                    KSTACK.COM.  The SET COMSPEC command will not be
                    present on most systems.  If it's there, remove it,
                    or change it to read:

                         SET COMSPEC=d:\path\COMMAND.COM

                    where "d:\path" is replaced by the correct drive and
                    directory for COMMAND.COM.  Then add "REM " in front
                    of  the KSTACK.COM command to convert it to a
                    comment, or delete the line entirely.

             Now reboot your system, and you should be back up and running
             under COMMAND.COM.  You can check the 4DOS directory for any
             files you placed there that you want to save.  Then delete
             the 4DOS files and remove the 4DOS directory if you wish to
             do so.

        ------------------------------------------------------------------



        Chapter 6 / 4OS2 Configuration and Notes


        4OS2 works well with virtually all computers that run OS/2 version
        2.1 or later.  This chapter provides the basic information you
        need to run 4OS2 in any of the standard PC environments.  If you
        need more detailed technical information or troubleshooting
        assistance on any of these topics, consult the Troubleshooting,
        Service, and Support topic in the 4OS2 online help.

        If you used the automated installation program to install 4OS2,
        you can safely skip this chapter, and return to it only if you
        have difficulty with the program or want to fine-tune it meet your
        needs.


        4OS2 Installation Notes

             You can install and use 4OS2 under OS/2 version 2.1 or above,
             including OS/2 Warp 3 and 4.

             When you install 4OS2, your OS/2 CONFIG.SYS file must be
             modified to make 4OS2 the default OS/2 command processor, and
             to update certain directives to include the path to your 4OS2
             files.  You can allow the installation software to make these
             changes automatically, or you can make them yourself at a
             later time (see Manual Installation of 4OS2 below for
             details).


        Manual Installation of 4OS2

             This section is for advanced users, and assumes you are
             generally familiar with CONFIG.SYS and other concepts such as
             ASCII editors and batch files.  In most cases you can select
             the installation options you need using the automated
             installation program, and manual installation is not
             necessary.

             In order to install 4OS2 manually, you must extract or copy
             the necessary files, brand 4OS2 if necessary, create or
             modify any configuration files you need, and then create the
             necessary commands to start the program on your system.


             Extracting or Copying the Program Files

             When you extract or copy the 4OS2 files, be sure to place
             them in their own directory, rather than using the same

             directory as a previous version of the program, a directory
             used by other JP Software products, or a directory used by
             other software.

             We strongly recommend that you place all of the 4OS2 files in
             the same directory.  See 4OS2 Files and Directories on page
             58 for some important considerations if you choose not to
             follow this recommendation.

             The method used to extract or copy the files depends on how
             you obtained your copy of the program:

                  * If you have a JP Software diskette you must use the
                    installation program described in the preceding
                    section because the files are compressed on the
                    distribution disk.  You cannot simply copy the files
                    onto your hard disk.  Select Custom Install and
                    follow the prompts to specify the installation
                    directory and copy the files.  Then exit the
                    installation program with Ctrl-X, or answer No when
                    prompted for whether to proceed with each additional
                    step.

                  * If you have a copy purchased electronically you must
                    use the installation program to extract the files as
                    described above.  First extract the installation
                    files from the compressed file you downloaded into a
                    temporary directory, then run the INSTALL program.
                    Use the Custom Install option as described in the
                    preceding paragraph.

                  * If you have the JP CD Suite, all of the files are
                    stored uncompressed on the CD, in the \4OS2
                    directory, and you can copy them manually if you
                    wish.  However, we still recommend that you use the
                    installation program described above to copy the
                    files.  Some files may be renamed after copying, and
                    some files are used only during the installation
                    process and do not need to be copied to your hard
                    disk.  If you copy the files manually, a few may not
                    have the correct names, and you may copy more files
                    than you need, resulting in wasted hard disk space.

                  * If you have a downloaded trial copy of the program,
                    or a copy distributed on a CD or diskette of trial
                    software, extract the files into a new directory
                    using the appropriate decompression program (e.g.
                    PKUNZIP or OS/2 UNZIP).

             "Branding" 4OS2

             (If you are not familiar with branding, refer to the general
             information on page 21 before continuing with this section.)

             If you have purchased a copy of 4OS2, the automated
             installation procedure will normally run the BR4OS2 program
             to check your name, serial number, and validation code and
             "brand" 4OS2 as a registered product (in some cases 4OS2 may
             not operate properly until this step is completed).  If you
             need to brand 4OS2 manually, start a 4OS2 or CMD.EXE session,
             change to the directory where 4OS2 is stored, and enter the
             command:

                  [c:\4os2300] br4os2

             Follow the instructions displayed by BR4OS2 to enter your
             name, serial number, and validation code.  All information
             must be entered exactly as shown on your original brand card,
             label, or electronically delivered branding information; you
             cannot change spelling, capitalization, or punctuation.

             If you are upgrading from a previous version and using an old
             copy of the BRAND.EXE program distributed with that version,
             you must start BRAND from a 4DOS, CMD.EXE, or COMMAND.COM
             session, not from 4OS2, because older versions of BRAND
             cannot brand 4OS2 while it is running.  (The newer BR4OS2
             program does not have this restriction.)


             Updating CONFIG.SYS

             When you're ready to finish installing 4OS2, you need to make
             five changes to your CONFIG.SYS file.  Use an ASCII editor to
             make these changes.  The examples below assume that 4OS2 is
             installed in the C:\4OS2300 directory; if you use a different
             directory, alter the instructions accordingly.

                  * Find the line in CONFIG.SYS that begins with the
                    words SET OS2_SHELL.  It should look something like
                    this:

                       SET OS2_SHELL=C:\OS2\CMD.EXE

                    Change the line to point to 4OS2.EXE, instead of
                    CMD.EXE.  The altered line should look something like
                    this:

                       SET OS2_SHELL=C:\4OS2300\4OS2.EXE

                    It should look something like this:

                       SET COMSPEC=C:\OS2\CMD.EXE

                    Change this line so that it also points to 4OS2.EXE:

                       SET COMSPEC=C:\4OS2300\4OS2.EXE

                  * Find the three lines that begin with SET BOOKSHELF,
                    SET DPATH, and LIBPATH (these lines may not all be
                    together in CONFIG.SYS).  Each is a list of
                    directories separated by semicolons, for example:

                       SET BOOKSHELF=C:\OS2\BOOK;...
                       SET DPATH=C:\OS2;...
                       LIBPATH=C:\OS2\DLL;...

                    Add a semi-colon [;] and the name of the 4OS2
                    directory to the end of each line:

                       SET BOOKSHELF=C:\OS2\BOOK;...;C:\4OS2300
                       SET DPATH=C:\OS2;... ;C:\4OS2300
                       LIBPATH=C:\OS2\DLL;... ;C:\4OS2300

             Check the changes you have made and save the CONFIG.SYS file.
             Then exit from your editor, shut down OS/2, and reboot your
             system.  You should be up and running under 4OS2 when you
             start a full-screen or windowed OS/2 command-line session.


             4OS2 Files and Directories

             We strongly recommend that you place all 4OS2 files in the
             same directory.  If you do not do so, you will probably have
             to explicitly set the locations of 4OS2 files to avoid
             problems.

             If you do wish to move files to different directories, the
             following information will help you set up the programs
             correctly:

                  4OS2.EXE is the 4OS2 program file.  It must be in the
                  directory specified in the SET OS2_SHELL and SET COMSPEC
                  lines in your CONFIG.SYS file as explained above.

                  JPOS2DLL.DLL is a library used by 4OS2.EXE (and by Take
                  Command for OS/2).  This file must be in a directory
                  listed in the LIBPATH setting in CONFIG.SYS.  If you

                  prefer, you can move this file into the standard OS/2
                  DLL directory, \OS2\DLL.

                  4OS2.INF contains the text for the 4OS2 help system.
                  For the help system to work properly, the directory
                  containing this file must be included in the BOOKSHELF
                  environment variable, which is usually set with a SET
                  BOOKSHELF command in CONFIG.SYS.  If you prefer, you can
                  move this file into the standard OS/2 bookshelf
                  directory, \OS2\BOOK.

                  4OS2H.MSG contains the help text for the /? option that
                  is available as part of each 4OS2 internal command.  For
                  this feature to work properly, the directory containing
                  this file must be included in the DPATH environment
                  variable, which is usually set with a SET DPATH command
                  in CONFIG.SYS.  If you prefer, you can move this file
                  into the standard OS/2 directory for such files,
                  \OS2\SYSTEM.

                  KEYSTACK.EXE is a utility used by the KEYSTACK command
                  to pass keystrokes to other applications.  For the
                  KEYSTACK command to work, this file must be in the same
                  directory as 4OS2.EXE, or in a directory included in
                  your PATH.

                  OPTION2.EXE is a utility used by the OPTION command to
                  configure 4OS2.  For the OPTION command to work, this
                  file must be in the same directory as 4OS2.EXE, or in a
                  directory included in your PATH.

                  SHRALIAS.EXE is a utility used by the SHRALIAS command
                  to save the shared alias and history lists between 4OS2
                  sessions.  For the SHRALIAS command to work, this file
                  must be in the same directory as 4OS2.EXE, or in a
                  directory included in your PATH.


        Creating Desktop Objects for 4OS2

             This section assumes you are running OS/2 Warp 4, with the
             default desktop shell and a standard OS/2 desktop.  If you
             are using an earlier version of OS/2 or a different shell, or
             have altered your OS/2 desktop configuration substantially,
             you will need to take those changes into account as you read
             the instructions below.

             The 4OS2 installation program normally creates a desktop
             folder which contains objects to start 4OS2 and its online
             help.  If you want to create additional objects in other

        ------------------------------------------------------------------


             folders, or directly on the desktop, click mouse button 2 on
             the installed 4OS2 object, select Copy on the popup menu, and
             copy the object to another location as desired.  You can then
             alter the properties of the new object if you wish.

             If you need to create a new 4OS2 object, switch to the folder
             where you want the object to appear and either copy an
             existing object (use the Copy or Create Another selection on
             the object's popup menu) or drag a Program Template in from
             the Templates folder.  The new object's Properties notebook
             should open automatically.  Use the Program page of the
             notebook to modify the path and file name, parameters, and
             startup directory.  You must also set the session type on the
             Session page of the notebook whenever the Path and File Name
             field is changed on the Program page.

             If you allowed the installation program to modify CONFIG.SYS,
             or made the appropriate changes manually so that 4OS2 is the
             default command interpreter named on the SET OS2_SHELL line,
             you can use an asterisk [*] in the Path and File Name field
             and the new object will start 4OS2 as the default command
             processor.  If you did not modify CONFIG.SYS for 4OS2, you
             must put the full path and filename for 4OS2.EXE in the Path
             and File Name field.

             You can put command-line switches, a command, or the name of
             a batch file in the Parameters field for any object.  This
             allows you to run specific commands or set configuration
             options when you start 4OS2 from that object.  However, no
             additional settings are required; the only required item is
             the drive and path for 4OS2.EXE (or an asterisk if 4OS2 is
             installed as your default command processor).  For details on
             the command line options available for 4OS2 objects see
             Chapter 4, and the Starting 4OS2 section of the online help.

             For more information on creating and configuring desktop
             objects see your OS/2 documentation.


        The 4OS2 Help System

             The 4OS2 help text, in the file 4OS2.INF, covers 4OS2
             features and internal commands.

             OS/2 ships with reference text for CMD.EXE internal and OS/2
             external commands, in the file \OS2\BOOK\CMDREF.INF.  This
             text is normally displayed along with 4OS2's help when the
             HELP command or F1 key is used, to assist you in obtaining
             help on external OS/2 commands like CHKDSK and FORMAT.

                                  Chapter 6 / 4OS2 Configuration and Notes
        ------------------------------------------------------------------


             To accomplish this, 4OS2 passes the help file name
             "4OS2+CMDREF" to the OS/2 help program, so that the help
             program opens both help "books".  You can specify a different
             set of "books" to be opened when HELP or F1 is invoked by
             adjusting the HelpBook directive in 4OS2.INI, or the
             corresponding entry on the Options 2 page in the
             configuration notebook.  For example, to set up 4OS2 so that
             only 4OS2 help is displayed (without the CMDREF book) when F1
             is pressed, you would include the following directive in
             4OS2.INI, or make the corresponding change in the
             configuration notebook:

                  HelpBook=4OS2

             When more than one book is listed in the HelpBook setting,
             the OS/2 help program will see the combined group as a single
             book.  The displayed Table of Contents will include the
             tables of contents from all the listed books, joined together
             as one group of topics with no divisions to show where one
             book ends and the next begins.  If any of the listed books
             are not available the help program will not start.

             If you start the help system from a windowed 4OS2 session,
             you will be returned to that session when you are done.  If
             you start the help system from a full-screen session, you
             must manually return to that session using standard OS/2
             methods for switching between sessions (this is due to the
             design of the OS/2 help system and is not a limitation of
             4OS2).

             You can also keep the help window on the screen and return to
             the 4OS2 session, switching between the two sessions as
             needed.  This may be useful when you are writing a batch
             file, working on a complex command, or experimenting with
             4OS2.

             The 4OS2 installation program sets up a separate object for
             the help system so that you can load the help file directly.
             To create a similar object manually, use entries like this on
             the Program page of the object's Settings notebook:

                  Path and File Name:      VIEW.EXE
                  Parameters:              4OS2
                  Working Directory:       d:\path

             where "d:\path" is the directory where you installed 4OS2.

             The help system can also be used to obtain help on OS/2 error
             codes.  If you type either of these commands:

                                  Chapter 6 / 4OS2 Configuration and Notes
        ------------------------------------------------------------------


                  [c:\] help nnnn
                  [c:\] help sysnnnn

             where "nnnn" is an OS/2 system error number, HELP will
             display an explanation of the OS/2 error.  This feature works
             by running the OS/2 program HELPMSG.EXE which opens the file
             OSO001.H to get the explanation.  For this feature to work,
             HELPMSG.EXE must be in a directory that is in your PATH, and
             the data file OSO001H.MSG must be in a directory in your
             DPATH (OS/2 sets up HELPMSG.EXE and OS0001H.MSG this way by
             default).

             You can also use the 4OS2 HELP command to change the PROMPT
             setting.  HELP ON will change the default prompt to $i[$p],
             and HELP OFF will change the default prompt to [$p].  This
             feature is included for compatibility with OS/2's CMD.EXE,
             and is implemented by running the HELP.CMD file which comes
             with OS/2 (typically stored in the \OS2 directory).  Changing
             the prompt is probably better accomplished by using the
             PROMPT command instead of HELP ON or HELP OFF.

             4OS2 also supports the /? switch to display help for any
             command.  Using /? will display brief help text for the
             command within the 4OS2 window.


        Using STARTUP.CMD

             If you have a STARTUP.CMD file in the root directory of your
             OS/2 boot drive, OS/2 will automatically create a windowed
             4OS2 session when the system boots and will tell that session
             to execute STARTUP.CMD.  (This is a feature of OS/2 and does
             not depend on 4OS2.  If CMD.EXE is your OS/2 command
             interpreter, it will be used to run STARTUP.CMD.)

             You can use STARTUP.CMD to start other sessions, to set up a
             global alias list, to execute the SHRALIAS command, etc.,
             just as you might use AUTOEXEC.BAT under DOS.  STARTUP.CMD
             will be executed once, when your system boots, not every time
             a 4OS2 session is started.

             If you place the command EXIT at the end of STARTUP.CMD, the
             session created to run STARTUP.CMD will end when that command
             is executed, and any global alias and history lists will be
             discarded (unless another 4OS2 session has been started or
             SHRALIAS has been executed).  If you don't include an EXIT,
             the session will remain open and can be used as a normal
             windowed 4OS2 session.  If you have a 4START file, it will be
             run before STARTUP.CMD.

        Uninstalling 4OS2 Manually

             For automated uninstall instructions, see page 23.

             To manually remove 4OS2 from your system, follow these steps:

                  * First, find the location of CMD.EXE on your disk (for
                    example, in the \OS2 directory).

                  * Delete or change any desktop objects that refer
                    directly to 4OS2.  If you want to continue using the
                    same objects to run programs or batch files with
                    CMD.EXE, substitute the full path to CMD.EXE for the
                    reference to 4OS2.  Change any startup parameters as
                    necessary.

                  * Use an ASCII editor to edit your CONFIG.SYS file.
                    Look for a line that starts SET OS2_SHELL, and
                    another that starts SET COMSPEC:

                         SET OS2_SHELL=C:\4OS2300\4OS2.EXE
                         SET COMSPEC=C:\4OS2300\4OS2.EXE

                    Change both lines to point to CMD.EXE, for example:

                         SET OS2_SHELL=C:\OS2\CMD.EXE
                         SET COMPSEC=C:\OS2\CMD.EXE

                  * Search the CONFIG.SYS file for any other mention of
                    the 4OS2 directory.  In a typical installation, the
                    directory name will be listed in the SET BOOKSHELF,
                    SET DPATH, and LIBPATH lines.  You may also have
                    added it to the SET PATH line (although the
                    installation program does not do so).  Remove each
                    reference to the 4OS2 directory, but leave the rest
                    of each line unchanged.

                  * Finally, if you have a STARTUP.CMD file in the root
                    directory of the boot drive, load it into your editor
                    and remove any references in it to 4OS2 and any
                    commands that depend on 4OS2 (such as commands that
                    load aliases).

             Now reboot your system, and you should be back up and running
             under CMD.EXE when you start a full-screen or windowed
             command-line session.  Check your 4OS2 directory for any
             files you placed there that you want to save.  Then you can
             then delete the 4OS2 files and remove the 4OS2 directory if
             you wish to do so.

        If you used the automated installation program to install 4NT, you
        can safely skip this chapter, and return to it only if you have
        difficulty with the program or want to fine-tune it meet your
        needs.


        4NT Installation Notes

             When you install 4NT under Windows NT 3.5 or 3.51, no system
             files will be modified.  If you install 4NT under Windows NT
             4.x the installation program will create a Start menu group
             for JP Software products, including 4NT.  In addition, a
             small group of entries will be added to the system registry
             (if you allow such modifications); for more details see page
             67.

             Installing 4NT does not modify, remove, or otherwise alter
             any of your other system files.

             If you regularly run 16-bit character-mode applications which
             "shell to DOS" (i.e., start a secondary command prompt
             session), including 16-bit MAKE utilities, we recommend that
             you enable the NTCMDPROMPT directive in the
             \WINNT\SYSTEM32\CONFIG.NT file.  This is a Windows NT feature
             which affects operation of shells started from 16-bit
             programs, and is not specifically related to 4NT.  However,
             in our experience using it improves operation, and prevents
             certain problems with secondary shells (e.g., requiring you
             to type an extra EXIT command to return to the parent
             application).  NTCMDPROMPT may or may not work well in your
             particular situation, and experimentation is usually required
             to determine the best configuration.  For further
             documentation on NTCMDPROMPT read the comments provided by
             Microsoft in CONFIG.NT.

        Manual Installation of 4NT

             This section is for advanced users and assumes you are
             generally familiar with ASCII editors, batch files, and other
             similar concepts.  In most cases you can select the
             installation options you need using the automated
             installation program, and manual installation is not
             necessary.

             In order to install 4NT manually, you must extract or copy
             the necessary files, brand 4NT if necessary, and then create
             desktop objects to start the program on your system.


             Extracting or Copying the Program Files

             When you extract or copy the 4NT files, be sure to place them
             in their own directory, rather than using the same directory
             as a previous version of the program, a directory used by
             other JP Software products, or a directory used by other
             software.

             We strongly recommend that you place all of the 4NT files in
             the same directory.  See 4NT Files and Directories on page 68
             for some important considerations if you choose not to follow
             this recommendation.

             The method used to extract or copy the files depends on how
             you obtained your copy of the program:

                  * If you have a JP Software diskette you must use the
                    installation program described in Chapter 2 because
                    the files are compressed on the distribution disk.
                    You cannot simply copy the files onto your hard disk.
                    Select Custom Install and follow the prompts to
                    specify the installation directory and copy the
                    files.  Then exit the installation program with Ctrl-
                    X, or answer No when prompted for whether to proceed
                    with each additional step.

                  * If you have a copy purchased electronically you must
                    use the installation program to extract the files as
                    described above.  First extract the installation
                    files from the compressed file you downloaded into a
                    temporary directory, then run the INSTALL program.
                    Use the Custom Install option as described in the
                    preceding paragraph.

                  * If you have the JP CD Suite, all of the files are
                    stored uncompressed on the CD, in the \4NT directory,

        ------------------------------------------------------------------


                    and you can copy them manually if you wish.  However,
                    we still recommend that you use the installation
                    program described above to copy the files.  Some
                    files may be renamed after copying, and some files
                    are used only during the installation process and do
                    not need to be copied to your hard disk.  If you copy
                    the files manually, a few may not have the correct
                    names, and you may copy more files than you need,
                    resulting in wasted hard disk space.

                  * If you have a downloaded trial copy of the program,
                    or a copy distributed on a CD or diskette of trial
                    software, extract the files into a new directory
                    using the appropriate decompression program (e.g.
                    PKUNZIP).


             "Branding" 4NT

             (If you are not familiar with branding, refer to the general
             information on page 21 before continuing with this section.)

             If you have purchased a copy of 4NT, the automated
             installation procedure will normally run the BR4NT program to
             check your name, serial number, and validation code and
             "brand" 4NT as a registered product (in some cases 4NT may
             not operate properly until this step is completed).  If you
             need to brand 4NT manually, start a 4NT or CMD.EXE ("MS-DOS
             Prompt") session, change to the directory where 4NT is
             stored, and enter the command:

                  [c:\4nt300] br4nt

             Follow the instructions displayed by BR4NT to enter your
             name, serial number, and validation code.  All information
             must be entered exactly as shown on your original brand card,
             label, or electronically delivered branding information; you
             cannot change spelling, capitalization, or punctuation.

             If you are upgrading from a previous version and using an old
             copy of the BRAND.EXE program distributed with that version,
             you must start BRAND from a CMD.EXE session, not from 4NT,
             because older versions of BRAND cannot brand 4NT while it is
             running.  (The newer BR4NT program does not have this
             restriction.)

             Updating System Files and the Registry for 4NT

             4NT doesn't require any changes to any system files.  Once
             you have placed the 4NT program files in their own directory,
             the installation is finished except for creating desktop
             objects to start the program (see page 68 below).

             JP Software distributes a file of registry extensions for
             4NT, for use under Windows NT 4.x.  The registry extensions
             are stored in the file JP4NT.INF.  Installing these
             extensions will:

                  * Designate 4NT .BTM files (enhanced batch files) as
                    batch files.  They will then be recognized as such by
                    the Windows Explorer;

                  * Provide an additional "open" option in the context
                    (mouse button 2) menu of all batch files, to
                    explicitly run the file with 4NT; and

                  * Create a new entry in the context menu of drives and
                    directories to launch 4NT in that drive / directory.

             You will have the option to install JP4NT.INF automatically
             during the 4NT installation process.  You can also install it
             manually by opening the 4NT directory from within the Windows
             Explorer, clicking on JP4NT.INF with mouse button 2, and
             selecting INSTALL from the popup menu.  If you have a
             downloaded trial copy of 4NT, JP4NT.INF will not be installed
             automatically; you must use manual installation.  See the
             comments in the file for additional details.

             JP4NT.INF assumes that you have a relatively standard system
             configuration.  If you have modified basic items in your
             registry (such as the characteristics of the system file type
             "batfile"), the registry extensions may not work correctly.

             To adjust the registry entries made when you install
             JP4NT.INF, open the Windows Explorer, and select Options on
             the View menu.  Click on the File Types tab and find the
             listing for batch files (typically under "MS-DOS Batch
             File").  Use the Edit button to adjust this listing.
             JP4NT.INF also makes minor changes to the Drive and Directory
             types; you may want to modify these as well.  Note that some
             of these file types may not be editable on your system,
             depending on the settings of various edit flags in the
             registry.

             To remove the registry entries created by JP4NT.INF, open the
             Windows Control Panel and select Add / Remove Programs.

             Select the item listed as "JP Software's 4NT Registry
             Extensions (remove only)" and click the Add / Remove button.
             The registry extensions will be removed without further
             prompting.  The removal operation may not work correctly if
             you modified the registry entries manually after they were
             created.

             JP Software's Take Command/32 also includes a .INF file which
             creates registry extensions, some of which are the same as
             those used by 4NT.  Therefore, if you remove the 4NT
             extensions you will also remove some extensions used by Take
             Command/32.  If this causes a problem you can correct it by
             manually reinstalling the Take Command/32 extensions after
             removing those for 4NT.


             4NT Files and Directories

             We strongly recommend that you place all 4NT files in the
             same directory.  If you do not do so, you will probably have
             to explicitly set the locations of 4NT files to avoid
             problems.

             If you do wish to move files to different directories, the
             following information will help you set up the programs
             correctly:

                  4NT.EXE is the 4NT program file.  It must be in the
                  directory specified in the Command Line field of every
                  4NT object.

                  4NT.HLP contains the text for the 4NT help system.
                  4NT.HLP must be in the same directory as 4NT.EXE.

                  SHRALIAS.EXE is a small utility that is used by the
                  SHRALIAS command to save the shared alias and history
                  lists between 4NT sessions.  For the SHRALIAS command to
                  work, this file must be in the same directory as
                  4NT.EXE, or in a directory included in your PATH.


        Creating Desktop Objects for 4NT

             The method you use to create a desktop object for 4NT depends
             on whether you are using Explorer or Program Manager as your
             shell.

             Creating Explorer Shortcuts

             This section assumes you are running Windows NT 4.x, with
             Explorer as your Windows shell, and with a standard Windows
             desktop.  If you are using Program Manager, see the next
             section.  If you have altered your Windows desktop
             configuration substantially, you may need to take those
             changes into account as you read the instructions below.

             When 4NT is installed it normally creates a JP Software
             program group which appears on the Start Menu under
             Programs, and includes items to start 4NT and its online
             help.  The installation program also creates a desktop
             shortcut for 4NT.  These entries are created based on the
             file JP4NTSC.INF, which is distributed with 4NT.

             If you have a downloaded trial copy of 4NT, JP4NTSC.INF may
             not be installed automatically; if you want to install it you
             may need to do so manually.  See the comments below and in
             the file for additional details.

             If you need to create a similar program group or shortcuts
             manually -- for example, if the JP Software group on the Start
             menu is inadvertently damaged or deleted -- you can use the
             Windows Explorer's facilities for creating shortcuts and
             modifying the desktop and / or the Start menu (see below).
             You can also reinstall JP4NTSC.INF manually if you wish;
             see the comments in the file for details.

             To remove the desktop shortcuts and group created by
             JP4NTSC.INF, open the Windows Control Panel and select Add
             / Remove Programs.  Select the item listed as "JP Software
             4NT shortcuts (remove only)" and click the Add / Remove
             button.  The 4NT shortcuts will be removed without further
             prompting, and the group will be removed if it becomes
             empty.  The removal operation may not work correctly if you
             modified the group or shortcuts manually after they were
             created.

             If you want to create additional shortcuts elsewhere on the
             Start menu, or modify the Programs entries, click mouse
             button 2 in an open area of the Task Bar, and select

             Properties on the popup menu.  Select the Start Menu Programs
             tab and modify or adjust the menus as required.

             You can also manually create one or more shortcuts on the
             desktop to run 4NT.  To do so click with mouse button 2 in
             any open area of the desktop.  On the popup menu click New,
             then Shortcut.  Fill in the drive and path as d:\path\4NT.EXE
             (use the appropriate drive and path for your system).  Add
             any other command line options you wish to set to the end of
             the line.

             You can also put command-line switches, a command, or the
             name of a batch file at the end of the command line for any
             shortcut.  This allows you to run specific commands or set
             configuration options when you start 4NT from that shortcut.
             For details on the command line options available, see
             Chapter 4 and the Starting 4NT section of the online help.

             For more information on creating and configuring shortcuts or
             modifying the Start Menu, see your Windows 95/98 or Windows
             NT documentation.


             Creating Program Manager Items

             This section applies to Windows NT 3.5 or 3.51 with Program
             Manager as the shell.

             When 4NT is installed it normally creates a program group
             which appears in the Program Manager, and includes items to
             run 4NT and its online help.  If you want to create a new
             item for 4NT in any group, use the Program Manager's File /
             New menu selection.  Set the command line to d:\path\4NT.EXE
             (use the appropriate drive and path for your system).

             You can put command-line switches, a command, or the name of
             a batch file at the end of the command line for any item.
             This allows you to run specific commands or set configuration
             options when you start 4NT from that item.


        The 4NT Help System

             When you start the 4NT help system, 4NT opens a new window to
             run the standard Windows NT help program.  The help program
             displays the help text from the file 4NT.HLP, and lets you
             browse through it.

        ------------------------------------------------------------------


             4NT's help text does not cover the Windows NT external
             commands because they are included in Windows NT's built-in
             Command Reference.

             If you start the help system from a 4NT window on the Windows
             NT desktop, you will be returned to that window when you
             close the help program.  However, if you have switched the
             window to full-screen mode before invoking the help system,
             you must return to 4NT manually (using standard Windows NT
             methods for switching between windows).  This is due to the
             design of Windows NT Help and is not a limitation of 4NT.

             You can also keep the help window on the screen and return to
             the 4NT window, switching between the two windows as needed.
             This may be useful when you are writing a batch file, working
             on a complex command, or experimenting with 4NT.

             In order for the 4NT help system to work properly, the help
             text file, 4NT.HLP, must be in the same directory as 4NT.EXE.

             The 4NT installation program sets up a separate object for
             the help system so that you can load the help file directly.
             To create a similar object manually, create an object with a
             command line like this:

                  Command Line:  WINHELP C:\4NT300\4NT.HLP

             (Change the drive and path to reflect the location of 4NT.HLP
             on your system.)

             4NT also supports the /? switch to display help for any
             command.  Using /? will display help for the command using
             the Windows NT help system.


        Uninstalling 4NT Manually

             For automated uninstall instructions, see page 23.

             The steps required to remove 4NT manually depend on the
             version of Windows NT you are using:

                  * If you installed the 4NT registry extensions, start
                    by removing them as described on page 67.

                  * Next, use the Windows Explorer or Program Manager to
                    remove any shortcuts or desktop objects for 4NT, or
                    manually uninstall the JP4NTSC.INF file as described
                    on page 69.

                  * Check the 4NT directory for any files you placed
                    there that you want to save.  Then you can then
                    delete the 4NT files and directory from your hard
                    drive.
