This has been removed from the LDM_SETEMPHASIS specification:
// - If a disk is selected (i.e. has selection emphasis, which implies keyboard
//   focus) then one of its partitions must be as well.  Thus, selecting a disk
//   will automatically select its first partition (unless the disk was already
//   selected, implying that a partition must also be selected already and so
//   no change is necessary).
// - Setting the LDV_FS_SELECTED flag on a WC_DISKVIEW will automatically set
//   LPV_FS_SELECTED for the first partition on the disk IF (and only if) the
//   disk did not already have LDV_FS_SELECTED set (in which case a partition
//   must already have this flag set, and this should not be changed).

// - If a partition has selection emphasis, then the disk that owns it must
//   also have selection emphasis.  Conversely, if a disk does not have
//   selection emphasis, then none of its partitions may have it either.

// - Setting the LPV_FS_SELECTED on a WC_PARTITIONVIEW will automatically set
//   the LDV_FS_SELECTED flag on the WC_DISKVIEW that owns it (if not already
//   set).

// - Clearing the LPV_FS_SELECTED flag on a WC_PARTITIONVIEW control has no
//   other side effects.
//
// There are no side effects associated with either setting or clearing the
// LPV_FS_ACTIVE flag on a WC_PARTITIONVIEW control.
