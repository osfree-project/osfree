                      Welcome to THE, The Hessling Editor.

INTRODUCTION
------------

THE is a full-screen character mode text editor based on the VM/CMS editor
XEDIT and many features of KEDIT written by Mansfield Software.

THE has currently been ported to the following platforms:
- most Unix systems; text mode and native X11 application
- OpenEdition on OS/390
- Linux/390
- 32bit DOS 
- OS/2
- Win32 
- QNX
- Amiga
- BeOS
- Mac OSX

THE OS/2 port is similar to EPM, runs within an OS/2 command window and is
HPFS aware. THE also uses the OS/2 Rexx interpreter to execute macro files.
An extensive interface exists between THE and Rexx giving THE the complete
power of Rexx.

Rexx support in the DOS DPMI and VCPI ports, QNX, Amiga and BeOS ports is 
provided by the free Rexx interpreter, Regina, which is available from
http://regina-rexx.sourceforge.net
THE OS/2 version uses the Rexx interpreter that is supplied with OS/2.
The Win9x/NT/2k/XP ports can use one of several Rexx interpreters. THE uses
the Rexx/Trans DLL which enables THE to find a suitable Rexx interpreter
at runtime.

For Unix ports, Rexx support is available with Regina (see above) and with
REXX/imc (http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/users/ian.collier/Rexx/tarfiles.html)
Under the AIX platform, THE can also use REXX/6000, available from IBM. The can
also use Object Rexx on Linux or AIX.

The HP-UX Porting and Archive Centre contains binary releases of THE for HP-UX 10
and 11. See: http://hpux.ee.ualberta.ca/hppd/hpux/Editors/

All zip files use Info-Zip's Zip 2.01.
Also note that the source files will be in Unix format (LF only to end line)
so unzipping under OS/2, DOS or Win9x/NT/2K/XP  use the -a switch.


Notes on Source Distribution:
----------------------------

THE uses curses as its screen handler. This makes it portable but not 
necessarily as fast as native screen handling routines.

To compile the DOS, OS/2 and Win32 ports you need PDCurses 2.5 (or later); a
public domain library of curses screen handling routines, of which I am 
the current maintainer. PDCurses 2.5 is available from:

http://pdcurses.sourceforge.net

You also require PDCurses 2.5 (or later) for the X11 port.

To assist with configuring THE to compile under Unix, a "configure" script
is included. This script should be able to set up most, if not all
requirements for compilation. Run configure with the --help switch to
determine what configuration options are available.

If you find bugs or major inconsistencies, please let me know. If you
manage to compile and run on a different platform to the above, please
send me any changes to the code and the makefile, so I can include the
patches in the official release.

Enjoy, Mark.
