APPENDIX 1 - ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
========================================================================

THE uses the following environment variables:

 THE_HOME_DIR - the directory in which THE looks for its help file(s) and macro(s)

 THE_HELP_FILE - the fully qualified file name containing help information.

 THE_PROFILE_FILE - the fully qualified file name for the default <profile> file.

 THE_MACRO_PATH - a list of all directories in which THE is to look for <macro> files.


-----------------------------------
Environment Variable Use under UNIX
-----------------------------------

If no environment variable; THE_HOME_DIR, is set prior to starting THE,
THE uses /usr/local/THE/ as the default value for ${THE_HOME_DIR} if running
under Unix.  This can be changed when running the configure script. See
the file INSTALL for further details.  

The default value of THE_HELP_FILE is THE_Help.txt. With no environment 
variables set, the help file to be looked for will be /usr/local/THE/THE_Help.txt.
If THE_HOME_DIR environment variable was set to /usr/opt/etc or changed in
the.c, the help file will be /usr/opt/etc/THE_Help.txt.

The name of the default profile file is $HOME/.therc.

The default value of THE_MACRO_PATH is ${THE_HOME_DIR}:. THE will look for 
a macro file first in ${THE_HOME_DIR} and then in the current directory. 
So with no environment variables set, THE looks for macros in 
$(THE_HOME_DIR} first and if no file exists in that directory, THE will 
look in the current directory. If the file does not exist in either of 
these places, an error message will be displayed.
The format of THE_MACRO_PATH is dir1:dir2:dir3 Each directory is seperated 
by colons. By default, up to 20 directories may be specified. This can be 
changed in the.h when building or by the <SET MACROPATH> command.


-----------------------------------------------------
Environment Variable Use under OS/2, DOS and Win95/NT
-----------------------------------------------------

                          *********

Under some circumstances the following default behaviour does not occur.
The reason is that THE.EXE sometimes cannot determine where it was run
from.  This is a due to the different ways that different operating
systems behave and how the C compiler used to build THE behaves.

It is probably better to explicitly set the environment variables than
hope that your particular environment will work as documented below.

                          *********

By default THE_HOME_DIR is set to the directory from which THE was 
invoked. Assuming THE.EXE resides in d:\tools, THE_HOME_DIR will equate 
to d:\tools\.

The default value of THE_HELP_FILE is THE_Help.txt.

The name of the default profile file is ${THE_HOME_DIR}profile.the.

The default value of THE_MACRO_PATH is ${THE_HOME_DIR};. THE will look for
a macro file first in THE_HOME_DIR and then in the current directory. So 
with no environment variables set, THE first looks for macros in the 
directory from which THE was invoked and then in the current directory. 
If the file does not exist in either directory, an error message is displayed.
The format of THE_MACRO_PATH is dir1;dir2;dir3 Each directory is seperated
by semi-colons. By default, up to 20 directories may be specified. This can
be changed by the <SET MACROPATH> command.
