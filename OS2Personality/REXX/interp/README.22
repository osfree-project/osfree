                         Regina 2.2
                        17 June 2001

Changes in this release (from 2.1)
----------------------------------

o Added multiple, named queues designed to be compatible with OS/2
  Rexx, but also provides cross machine/platform capabilities. ie
  you can push lines on a named queue on say Linux, and pull them
  off that queue from a Rexx program running under Windows.
  Provides the BIF rxqueue(), the external stack server; rxstack, and
  the external client application; rxqueue. rxstack is designed to run
  as a daemon process on Unix platforms, and an NT Service under NT/2k.
  Other platforms can run rxstack as a normal foreground program.
o Updated documentation to version 2.2, to include changes from
  0.08e up to 2.2. Base documentation now in StarWriter 5.2 format
  rather than MS Word.
o Fixed bug with input/output redirection on non-Unix platforms.
  ie '>LIFO sort >FIFO' now works correctly.
o Changes to rexxsaa.h to allow MingW32 compiler to link with VC++ built
  regina.lib
o Addition of SAA API calls; RexxCreateQueue(), RexxDeleteQueue(),
  RexxAddQueue(), RexxPullQueue() and RexxQueryQueue().
o Addition of Rexx Macro Space functions. These are stubs at the moment.
o To comply with the File Hierarchy Standard (FHS), Regina program
  files are installed, by default on Unix systems, in /usr directory, 
  rather than /usr/local.
  eg. /usr/bin/regina rather than /usr/local/bin/regina
  To achieve the same behaviour as previous releases, 
     configure --prefix=/usr/local
o Removed UNION_EXIT #define in rexxsaa.h. This was baggage from old
  versions of Regina, and is now not supported.
o Win32 port now packaged as self-extracting InstallShield package.
o Change to RexxStart() API function. When specifying a default environment
  that is an internal environment, don't add a new one, but use the details
  of the existing internal environment. This allows OS commands to be run
  correctly.
o Fixed the non-random bug with RANDOM BIF on non-Unix platforms. (Paul Barnett)
o QNX RTP support added.
o Fix for excessive copying of parameters for most BIFs. Speeds up functions
  like LEFT and SUBSTR as reported by Dennis Baeris and others.
  (Paul Barnett)
o Internal change: save currentnode across calls to interpret() (Paul Barnett)
o Minor change to code to cleanly build on Mac OS X.
o Environment variable PATH now also used to find Rexx programs from the
  command line and externally called programs.
o Added new system exit handler; RXENV and subhandlers; RXENVSET and RXENVGET.
  These system exits are called when the VALUE BIF is called to get or
  set a variable in the external environment as opposed to the Rexx
  variable pool.
o Partial AtheOS port.
o Added -v switch to Regina executables to display Regina version string.
o UNAME BIF now reports correct Windows operating system name.
o Full support for building Regina under Win32 Cygwin environment including
  building DLLs.
o Win32 Binary distribution now comes with import libraries for Cygwin,
  Borland and MingW32 compilers.
o Initial attempt of port to MacOS 8.1+ 68k.  Doesn't work yet!
o Minor changes to allow Regina to run on 64bit machines.

Cheers, Mark.
